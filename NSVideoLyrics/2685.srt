And act like you dont know me

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,460
But last night you were calling me

5
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,840
Saying you want me

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,900
Oh why you always make me feel

00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,520
Like I'm the one thats crazy

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,150

00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,590
We'll never get where

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,460

Round and round

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,090
You tried to pull me close

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,020
And whisper in my ear

26
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,960
You always told me lies

27
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,840
I cried out all my tears

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,840
I pushed my feelings to the side

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,840
But then you bring them back

30
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,460
B-bring them back
