00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,430
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,800
There's nothing that 100 men or more could ever do

00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,100
Just like the rain down in Africa

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,500
It's gonna take some time

5

Friends are cool but we both know

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,710
They don't want to see us together

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,080
Don't wanna loos what I live for

00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,040
I bet we get it right this time, time

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,590
As long as you're prepared to fight, fight

00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,160
I don't wanna live another day

20
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,940
Without your body next to me

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,270
I'm not gonna let them break us down

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,630

but I know you're worth fighting for!

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,780
What They say, it don't even matter

32
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,660
They don't really understand

33
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,070
Without each other we are barely breathing

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,460
Let's get air in these hearts again

35

As long as you're prepared to fight, prepared to fight

39
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,140
I don't wanna live another day

40
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,150
Without your body next to me

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm not gonna let them break us down

42
