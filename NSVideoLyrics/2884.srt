1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,510
Today I don't feel like doing anything

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,490
I just wanna lay in my bed

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,980
Don't feel like pickin up my phone

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,620
So leave a message at the tone

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,740
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,090
I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,820
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,150
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:39,940
Nah!

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,950
I'll be lounging on a couch, just chillin in my snuggie

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,600
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to Douggie,

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,990
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin man

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,540
Yes, I said it

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,370
I said it, 'cause I can!

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Today I don't feel like doing anything

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,680
I just wanna lay in my bed

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,280

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,150
Nothing at all

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,630
Nothing at all

22
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,210
Tomorrow I wake up do some P90x

23
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,580
Meet a really nice girl

24
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,000
Have some really nice sex

25
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,360
And she's gonna scream out this is great

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,560
Oh my God, this is great

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,350
Yeah!

28
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,390
I might mess around and get my college degree,

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,880
I bet my old man will be so pround of me.

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,790
But sorry paps you'll just have to wait

31
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,900
Yes, I said it

32
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,640
I said it, 'cause I can!

33
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,970
Today I don't feel like doing anything

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,080
I just wanna lay in my bed

'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

38
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,250
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair

39
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,030
'Cause I ain't going anywhere

40
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,370
No,

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,130
I'll just strut in my birthday suit,

42
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,230
And let everything hang loose

43
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,550
Yeah,

44
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,240
