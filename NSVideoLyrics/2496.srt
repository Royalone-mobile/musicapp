1
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:14,513
I've made up my mind,

2
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:17,613
Don't need to think it over,

3
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:20,213
if I'm wrong I am right,

4
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:23,613
Don't need to look no further,

5
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:25,413
This ain't lust,

6
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:33,913
I know this is love but,

7
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:36,613
If I tell the world,

8
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:39,413
I'll never say enough,

9
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:42,213
Cause it was not said to you,

10
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:46,313
And thatï¿½s exactly what I need to do,

11
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:52,113
If I'm in love with you,

12
00:00:52,163 --> 00:00:54,013
Should I give up,

13
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:58,213
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

14
00:00:58,263 --> 00:01:02,513
Even if it leads nowhere,

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,013
Or would it be a waste?

16
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:07,913
Even If I knew my place

17
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:11,613
Should I leave it there?

18
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:13,613
Should I give up

19
00:01:13,663 --> 00:01:17,613
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

20
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:26,613
Even if it leads nowhere.

21
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:29,213
I'd build myself up,

22
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:32,013
And fly around in circles,

23
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:35,113
Wait then as my heart drops,

24
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:38,113
And my back begins to tingle

25
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:43,813
Finally could this be it, Or

26
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:47,313
Should I give up,

27
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:50,713
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

28
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:55,113
Even if it leads nowhere,

29
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:57,513
Or would it be a waste?

30
00:01:57,563 --> 00:02:00,413
Even If I knew my place

31
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:04,713
Should I leave it there?

32
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:06,613
Should I give up

33
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:10,213
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

34
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:19,213
Even if it leads nowhere.

35
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:21,013
Should I give up,

36
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:24,713
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

37
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:30,213
Even if it leads nowhere,

38
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,813
Or would it be a waste?

39
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:35,913
Even If I knew my place

40
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:39,013
Should I leave it there?

41
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:42,513
Should I give up

42
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:48,513
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

43
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:58,213
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

44
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:01,213
Should I give up,

45
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:04,313
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

46
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:08,313
Even if it leads nowhere,

47
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:10,813
Or would it be a waste?

48
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:13,913
Even If I knew my place

49
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:17,513
Should I leave it there?

50
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,613
Should I give up

51
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,613
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

52
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:33,663
Even if it leads nowhere.
