1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,830
All my people
in the crowd

2
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,650
Grab a partner to
take it down!

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,120
It's me against the music

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,380
It's just me
And me

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,150
Yeah,
C'mon

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,700
Hey Britney?

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,960
Are you ready?

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,440
Are you?

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,810
And no one cares,

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,090
It's whippin' my hair,
it's pullin' my waist

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,730
To hell with stares

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,110
The sweat is drippin'
all over my face

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,740
And no one's there,

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,050
I'm the only one
dancin' up in this place

15
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,680
Tonight I'm here

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,760
Feel the beat of the drum,
gotta keep it that bass

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,690
I'm up against the speaker,
tryin' to take on the music

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,110
It's like a competition,
me against the beat

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,420
I wanna get in the zone,

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,750
If you really wanna battle,
saddle up and get your rhythm

21
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,220
Tryin' to hit it,
you could die in a minute

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,330
I'm a take a you on,

23
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,890

So how would you like
a friendly competition

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,340
Let's take on the song,

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,220
It's you and me baby,
we're the music

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,120
Time to party
all night long

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
All night long

We're almost there

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,030
I'm feelin' it bad
and I can't explain

36
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,770
My soul is bare

37
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,090
My hips are movin'
at a rapid pace

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,800
Can you
feel it burn,

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,100
From the tip of my toes
runnin' through my veins

40
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,680
And now,
it's your turn

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,730
Let me see what you got,
don't hesitate

42
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,610
I'm up against the speaker,
tryin' to take on the music

43
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,150
It's like a competition,

00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,260
Tryin' to hit it,
