1
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,130
Lembrei desse sentimento

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,690
Gritando dentro de nós

3
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,250
Éramos todos meninos

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,610
E em cada um vivia uma paixão

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,920
Como na cena de um filme

6
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,140
Vencemos pesadelos, enfrentando os dragões

7
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,570
Criados por nossos medos

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,810
Fruto da imaginação

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,690
De frente a uma nova era

10
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,730
Na onda de uma canção

11
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,310
Nós construímos história

12
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,690
Mente, alma e coração

13
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,550
Long live the walls We crashed through

14
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,020
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,840
I was screaming long live all the magic we made

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
And bring on all the pretenders

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,540
One day we will be remembered

18
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,110
I said: remember this feeling

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,950
I passed the pictures around

20
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,580
Of all the years that we stood there

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,830
On the side-lines wishing for right now

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,100
We are the kings and the queens

23
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,400
You traded your baseball cap for a crown

24
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,680
When they gave us our trophies

25
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,950
And we held them up for our town

26
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,740
De frente a uma nova era

27
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,810
Na onda de uma canção

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,120
Nós construímos história

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
Mente, alma e coração

30
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,610
Long live the walls we crashed through

31
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,970
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,780
I was screaming long live all the magic we made

33
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,790
And bring on all the pretenders

34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm not afraid

35
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,130
Long live all the mountains we moved

36
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,100
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you

37
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,550
I was screaming long live

38
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,740
The look on your face

39
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,630
And bring on all the pretenders

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,410
One day we will be remembered

41
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,160
Hold on, just spinning around

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,690
Confetti falls to the ground

43
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:35,830
May these memories break our fall

44
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,780
Lembrei do momento

45
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,830
Que fiz promessa pra nós dois

46
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,090
Pintando o nosso destino

47
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,460
Puro e simples, pleno e sem fim

48
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,900
Que fosse assim sem "goodbye"

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,680
Fosse pra sempre um cheguei

50
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,250
O sonho que construímos

51
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,340
Me vi feliz, eu te achei

52
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,410
Será muito mais que achar

53
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,230
Será muito além que pensar

54
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,700
Long live the walls we crashed through

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,210
I had the time of my life with you

56
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,100
Long, long live the walls we crashed through

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,660
How the kingdom lights shined Just for me and you

58
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,390
I was screaming long live all the magic we made

59
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,430
And bring on all the pretenders

60
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,620
I'm not afraid

61
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,940
Singing long live all the mountains we moved

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,760
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you

63
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,210
Long, long live

64
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,410
The look on your face

65
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,580
And bring on all the pretenders

66
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,420
One day

67
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,380
We will be remembered
