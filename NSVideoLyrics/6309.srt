00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,540

I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere (dah!)

27
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,500
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,400
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed

Down in DR, they're looking for Visa's

46
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,510
I ain't talking credit cards if you know what I mean!

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,160
