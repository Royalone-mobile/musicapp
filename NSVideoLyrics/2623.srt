1
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,280
What it is, Folk.

2
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,390
This right here is the 16 year old phenome, Chris Breezy.

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,570
Me, myself, I'm the 23 yr. old CEO

4
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,770
Young Carter, I'm harder then them other boys.

5
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,240
I ain't even fronting, baby I can take a summer off.

6
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,770
I can break a woman off.

7
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,810
I can take the stomach off, one of my trucks.
Now I'm riding in the goods.

8
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,210
Line it on up, guarantee you get served.

9
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,240
Lil' Chris, said run it,
So I ran and told her.

10
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,850
I'm a cash money young'n,
Bird-man junior.

11
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,880
Just a president, looking for a minor occurrence.

12
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,490
The young boy just turned 16 and I got

13
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,300
6 4's and hot bikes that I rock.

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,030
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock,

15
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,660
but all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him.

16
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,600
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop,

17
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,330
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk.

18
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,990
That sassy tempo with that walk,

19
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,870
May be the reason that all this teenies may never see me.

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,730
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)

21

23
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,630

24
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,670
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)

25

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,600

28
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,010
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you,

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,740
What ya body got a young boy ready to do.

30
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,360
If you take a chance, and let me put them things on you,

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,320
I could show you why I make them straight A's in school.

32
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,680
I'm a HUSTLA!

33
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,150
Trust my frame and age.

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,760
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page.

35
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,020
I can PICTURE!

36
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,410
Us switching lanes in the coupe

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,630
With you on the phone screaming my name.

38
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,830

46
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,900

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,180
You rock'n wit young Chris and the best rapper.

56
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,850
So leave your phone, bring your friends, let the rest happen.

57
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,610
A lil' patron, a lil' hen, I'm on Cavalli Vodka.

58
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,610
I'm in Cavalli jeans, got on Cavalli boxers.

59
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,590
I'm fresher than a newborn.

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,130
And um:l can work you out like a futon.

I learned that from a Biggy song.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,630
On to a new one.

69
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,870
Some like a redbone.

70
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,730
Ohh I think she like me, she got me on a ringtone.

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,670
And I told her, "Get yours, girl and don't you stop."
