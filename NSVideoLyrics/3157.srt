1
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,280
Baby, can't you see

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm calling

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,830
A guy like you should wear a warning

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,370
It's dangerous

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,730
I'm falling

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,770
There's no escape

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,800
I can't wait

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,080
I need a hit

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,120
Baby, give me it

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,460
You're dangerous

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,190
I'm loving it

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,770
Tonight

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,800
Can't calm down

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,860
Losin' my head

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,950
Spinnin' 'round and 'round

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,290
Do you feel me now?

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,450
With the taste of your lips

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm on a ride

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,310
Your toxic tongue slippin' mine (Ohh Ohh)

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,760
With the taste of the poison paradise

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,180
I'm addicted to you

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,270
Don't you know that your toxic?

23
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,930
And I love what you do

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,700
Don't you know that your toxic?

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,700
It's getting late to give you up

26
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,120
I took a sip from a devil's cup

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,100
Slowly, It's taking over me

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,810
Tonight

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,850
Can't calm down

30
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,190
It's in the air and it's all around

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,510
Can you feel me now?

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,470
With the taste of your lips

33
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,150
I'm on a ride

34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,830
Your toxic tongue slippin' mine (Ohh Ohh)

35
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,870
With the taste of the poison paradise

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,150
