1
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,390
You take a deep breath

2
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,500
And you walk through the doors

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
It's the morning of your very first day

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,190
And you say hi to your friends

5
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,510
You ain't seen in a while

6
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,160
Try and stay out of everybody's way

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,640
It's your freshman year

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,640
And you're gonna be here

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,250
For the next four years in this town

10
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,480
Hoping one of those senior boys

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,640
Will wink at you and say

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,780
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,620
'Cause when you're fifteen

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,880
And somebody tells you they love you

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,040
You're gonna believe them

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,320
And when you're fifteen feeling like

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,650
There's nothing to figure out

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,000
But, count to ten, take it in

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,600
This is life before you know

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,610
Who you're gonna be

21
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,010
Fifteen

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,480
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,450
And soon enough you're best friends

24
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,110
Laughing at the other girls

25
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,950
Who think they're so cool

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,650
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

27
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,780
And then you're on your very first date

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,340
And he's got a car

29
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,230
And you're feeling like flying

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,700
And you're momma's waiting up

31
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,230
And you're thinking he's the one

32
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,700
And you're dancing 'round your room

33
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,690
When the night ends,

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,310
When the night ends

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,060
'Cause when you're fifteen

36
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,340
And somebody tells you they love you

37
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,380
You're gonna believe them

38
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,260
When you're fifteen and your first kiss

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,040
Makes your head spin 'round

40
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,650
But in your life you'll do things greater than

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,770
Dating the boy on the football team

42
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,350
But I didn't know it at fifteen

43
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,940
When all you wanted was to be wanted

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,510
Wish you could go back

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,890
And tell yourself what you know now

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,770
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday

47
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,430
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

48
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,830
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy

49
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,420
Who changed his mind and we both cried

50
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,420
'Cause when you're fifteen

51
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,790
And somebody tells you they love you

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,920
You're gonna believe them

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,240
And when you're fifteen,

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't forget to look before you fall

55
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,110
I've found time can heal most anything

56
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,040
And you just might find who you're supposed to be

57
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,170
I didn't know who I supposed to be

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,910
At fifteen

59
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,090
Your very first day

60
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,950
Take a deep breath girl

61
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,570
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
