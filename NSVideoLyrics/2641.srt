1
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:30,081
Show me the meaning of being lonely

2
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:41,354
So many words for the broken heart

3
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:46,238
It's hard to see in a crimson love

4
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:49,495
So hard to breathe

5
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,698
Walk with me, and maybe

6
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:57,989
Nights of light so soon become

7
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:03,395
Wild and free I could feel the sun

8
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,601
Your every wish will be done

9
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:09,881
They tell me

10
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:15,481
Show me the meaning of being lonely

11
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:21,170
Is this the feeling I need to walk with

12
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:28,268
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

13
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:32,819
There's something missing in my heart

14
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:43,830
Life goes on as it never ends

15
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:49,203
Eyes of stone observe the trends

16
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:55,694
They never say forever gaze upon me

17
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,495
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)

18
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,674
There's no control

19
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,450
Are you with me now?

20
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:11,331
Your every wish will be done

21
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:12,915
They tell me

22
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,429
Show me the meaning of being lonely

23
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:24,312
Is this the feeling I need to walk with

24
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:32,291
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

25
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:35,979
There's something missing in my heart

26
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:38,597
There's nowhere to run

27
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:41,847
I have no place to go

28
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:47,956
Surrender my heart, body, and soul

29
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:48,884
How can it be

30
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,432
You're asking me

31
00:02:50,467 --> 00:03:01,125
To feel the things you never show?

32
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:19,031
You are missing in my heart

33
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:27,290
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

34
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:32,909
Show me the meaning of being lonely

35
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:38,629
Is this the feeling I need to walk with

36
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:46,655
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

37
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,901
There's something missing in my heart
