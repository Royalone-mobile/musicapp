00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,050
There's a fire starting in my heart,

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,450
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,150
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,650
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,150
See how I leave, with every piece of you

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,750
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

Think of me in the depths of your despair.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,650
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.
