 1
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,370
I don't wanna be left
2
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,630
In this war tonight !
3
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,000
Am I alone in this fight?
4
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,350
Is anybody out there?
5
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,700
Don't wanna be left, left in this world behind
6
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,250
Say you'll run to my side
7
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,000
Something 'bout mary, never won a pageant
8
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,620
Never felt pretty, never looked like cameron
9
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,990
Diaz was her last name, always been abandoned
10
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,630
Keep your head up, baby girl this is your anthem
11
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,130
There goes hannah, showin' off her banner
12
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,620
Rocking that crown, make them boys go bananas
13
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,060
When you're insecure about yourself, it's a fact
14
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,100
You can point a finger,but there's three pointing back
15
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,460
I can see her crying out, yeah
16
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,830
Is there anybody out there?
17
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,780
She's really counting on your love, still struggling uphill,
18
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,200
But you act like you don't care
19
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,700
Right now she could really use a shoulder
20
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,130
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
21
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,250
She's crying for your love tonight
22
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,960
Loneliest heart to survive, she said
23
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,100
I don't wanna be left
24
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,400
In this war tonight
25
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,530
Am I alone in this fight?
26
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,980
Is anybody out there?
27
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,370
Don't wanna be left, left in this world behind
28
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,620
Say you'll run to my side
29
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,610
Is anybody out there? yeah, yeah, yeah
30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,370
Is anybody out there?
31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,360
(somebody, anybody)
32
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,730
His name was adam, when his mom had him
33
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,290
Dad was a phantom never took a look at him
34
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,720
Grew up mad and antisocial
35
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,390
Hated outdoors, always in playing madden
36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,820
Adam was lonely, drugs were the only
37
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,410
Way out of his own life, now he's slowly
38
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,850
losing his fire, close to retire
39
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,780
With one last hope he puts his arms up higher
40
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,230
I can see him crying out, yeah
41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,590
Is there anybody out there?
42
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,030
He's really counting on your love
43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,710
Still struggling uphill
44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,080
But you act like you don't care
45
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,450
Right now he could really use a shoulder
46
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,700
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
47
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,760
He's crying for your love tonight
48
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,690
Loneliest heart to survive, he said
49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,560
I don't wanna be left
50
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,180
In this war tonight
51
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,300
Am I alone in this fight?
52
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,300
Is anybody out there?
53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,110
Don't wanna be left, left in this world behind
54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,480
Say you'll run to my side
55
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,540
Is anybody out there?
56
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,220
If you feel the way I feel
57
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,720
Like you've been talking to yourself
58
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,710
Well this one's for everyone who's felt invisible
59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,890
Lonely in a crowded room
60
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,950
Searching for someone like you
61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,620
Can't do it all alone (no one can baby)
62
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,870
Can't do it all alone (no one should baby)
63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,090
Is anybody out there?
64
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,860
(somebody, anybody)
65
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,170
Is anybody out there?
66
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,940
(I'm right here for you)
67
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,790
Is anybody out there?
68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,220
I don't wanna be left
69
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,650
In this war tonight
70
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,020
Am I alone in this fight?
71
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,640
Is anybody out there?
72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,680
Don't wanna be left left in this world behind
73
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,990
Say you'll run to my side
74
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,000
Is anybody out there? yeah, yeah, yeah
75
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,440

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,780
I don't wanna do it all alone
77
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,340
(I need your love to take me home)
78
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,830
I need your love to take me home
79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,370
(No one said you should be all alone)
80
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,930
No one said you should be all alone
81
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,350
