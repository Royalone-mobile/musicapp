1
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,219
Sittin' over here

2
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:05,177
Starin' in your face

3
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,160
With lust in my eyes

4
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:07,479
Sure don't give a damn and ya

5
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:09,676
Don't know that I've been dreamin' of ya

6
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:11,945
In my fantasy

7
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,541
Never once you looked at me,

8
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,583
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you

9
00:01:15,762 --> 00:01:17,013
To fulfill my needs

10
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,129
Think what you want

11
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:18,978
Let your mind free

12
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:21,101
Run free to a place that no one dares to

13
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:22,626
How many nights

14
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,529
I've laid in bed excited over you

15
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:27,015
I've closed my eyes

16
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:30,063
And thought of us a hundred different ways

17
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,596
I've gotten there so many times

18
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,529
I wonder how 'bout you

19
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,363
Day and night, day

20
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:38,798
All I've got to say is

21
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,931
If I was your girl...

22
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,464
Oh the things I'll do to you

23
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:45,469
I'd make you call out my name

24
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:48,367
I'd ask who it belongs to

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,205
If I was your woman,

26
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:52,164
The things I'd do to you

27
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,411
But I'm not, so I can't,

28
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:55,855
Then I won't

29
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:00,418
But, if I was your girl

30
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:26,066
How many nights

31
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,297
I've laid in bed excited over you

32
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:30,763
I've closed my eyes

33
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,958
And thought of us a hundred different ways

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,550
I've gotten there so many times

35
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:38,206
I wonder how 'bout you

36
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,270
Day and night, day

37
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,804
All I've got to say is

38
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:44,559
If I was your girl...

39
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,804
Oh the things I'll do to you

40
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:49,225
I'd make you call out my name

41
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,239
I'd ask who it belongs to

42
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:53,926
If I was your woman,

43
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,884
The things I'd do to you

44
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,166
But I'm not, so I can't,

45
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,380
Then I won't

46
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,025
But, if I was your girl

47
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:02,789
If I was your girl...

48
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,979
Oh the things I'll do to you

49
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,681
I'd make you call out my name

50
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:10,333
I'd ask who it belongs to

51
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:12,087
If I was your woman,

52
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:14,080
The things I'd do to you

53
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:16,243
But I'm not, so I can't,

54
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,433
Then I won't

55
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:18,011
But

56
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,357
If I was your girl
