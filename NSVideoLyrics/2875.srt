00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,350
I keep your picture beside my bed,

2
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:47,950
And I still remember everything you said,

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,450
I always thought our love was so right

4
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,550
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:07,950
Always thought you'll be by my side papa now you gone.

11
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:45,650
Still light the fire on a rainy night,

12
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:57,550
I still like it better when you holdin' me tight,

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,950
Everbody said..
