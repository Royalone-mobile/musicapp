Here we go
Talk to me

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,260
Your touch is
so magic to me

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,710
The strangest
things can happen

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,630
The way that
you react to me

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,150
I wanna do something
you can't imagine

14
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,390
Imagine if there was a million me's
talking sexy to you like that

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,040
You think
you can handle, boy

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,770
If I give you my squeeze and
I need you to push it right back

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,040
Baby, show me,
show me

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,290
What's your favorite trick
that you wanna use on me

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,640
And I'll volunteer

20
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,060
And I'll be flowing
and going

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,110
Till clothing disappears,
ain't nothing but shoes on me

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,570
Oh, baby

23
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,530
All night, show it,
just you and the crowd

24
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,350
Doing tricks you
never seen

25
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,930
And I bet that
I can make you believe

26
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,010
In love and sexy magic

27
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,600
So let me drive
my body around you

28
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,340

In love

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,260
Everything ain't
what it seems

32
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,530
I wave my hands
and I got you

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,620
And you feel
so fly assisting me

34
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,740
But now it's my turn
to watch you

35
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,190
I ain't gonna stop you

36
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,420
If you wanna
crowd my neck

37
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,090
Talk sexy to me
like that

38
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,800
Just do what
I taught you, girl

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,710
When I give you my heat
and I need you to push it right back

40
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,930
