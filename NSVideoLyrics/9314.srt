1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,690
There are times

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,880
When I just want to look

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,810
At your face

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,370
With the stars in the night

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,750
There are times

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
When I just want to feel

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,490
Your embrace

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,860
In the cold night

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,660
I just can't believe

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,250
That you are mine now

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,500
You were just a dream

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,870
That I once knew

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,430
I never thought

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,240
I would be right for you

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,170
I just can't compare you with

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,600
Anything in this world

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,100
You're all I need

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:14,210
To be here with forevermore

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,680
All those years

20
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,530
I longed to hold you in my arms

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,400
I've been dreamin' of you

22
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,650
Every night

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,710
I've been watching all the stars

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,360
That fall down

25
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,220
Wishing you will be mine

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,500
I just can't believe

27
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,490
That you are mine now

28
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,610
You were just a dream

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,730
That I once knew

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,290
I never thought

31
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,220
I would be right for you

32
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,090
I just can't compare you with

33
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,460
Anything in this world

34
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,020
You're all I need

35
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,380
To be here with forevermore

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,120
Time and again

37
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,610
There are these changes

38
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,420
That we cannot end

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,040
As sure as the time

40
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:50,410
Keeps going on and on

41
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,050
My love for you

42
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,040
Will be forevermore

43
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,350
Oh

44
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,640
Yeah

45
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,570
I just can't believe

46
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,120
That you are mine now

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,530
You were just a dream

48
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,780
That I once knew

49
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,400
I never thought

50
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,270
I would be right for you

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,010
I just can't compare you with

52
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,190
Anything in this world

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,750
As endless as forever

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,680
Our love will stay together

55
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,050
You are all I need

56
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:09,610
To be here with forevermore

57
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,870
Forevermore

58
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,240
You're all I need

59
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:30,190
To be here with forevermore

60
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:37,610
Yeah
