Wanna put my EP a chance a girl
12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,350
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,850

Snow falling on your hair, and I don't, I don't

Wanna get it off
23

Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,660
Wanna be your biggest gift
25
