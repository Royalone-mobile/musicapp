1
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,590
I never gone with the wind

2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,720
Just let it flow

3
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,240
Let it take me where it wants to go

4
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,270
Till you open the door

5
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,410
There's so much more

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,780
I've never seen it before

7
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,270
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings

8
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,900
You came along and you changed everything

9
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,620
You lift my feet off the ground

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,080
You spin me around

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,980
You make me crazier, crazier

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,500
Feels like I'm falling and I,

13
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,930
I'm lost in your eyes

14
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,920
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

15
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,200
I watched from a distance as you

16
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,710
Made life your own

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,080
Every sky was your own kind of blue

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,360
And I wanted to know how

19
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,670
That would feel

20
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,140
And you made it so real

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,040
You showed me something that I couldn't see

22
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,610
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,450
You lift my feet off the ground

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,950
You spin me around

25
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,670
You make me crazier, crazier

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,290
Feels like I'm falling and I,

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,740
I'm lost in your eyes

28
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,230
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

29
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,370
Baby you showed me what living is for

30
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,240
I don't want to hide anymore

31
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,160
You lift my feet off the ground

32
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,380
You spin me around

33
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,420
You make me crazier, crazier

34
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,960
Feels like I'm falling and I,

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,970
I'm lost in your eyes

36
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,590
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

37
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,340
Crazier

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,580
Crazier
