1
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,140
Remember all the things we wanted

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,410
Now all our memories, they're haunted

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,970
We were always meant to say goodbye

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,210
Even with our fists held high

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,510
It never would've worked out right

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,120
We were never meant for do or die

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,110
I didn't want us to burn out

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,150
I didn't come here to hold you

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,720
Now I can't stop

10
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:00,260
I want you to know that it doesn't matter

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,390
Where we take this road

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,460
Someone's gotta go

13
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,920
And I want you to know

14
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,010
You couldn't have loved me better

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,420
But I want you to move on

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,080
So I'm already gone

17
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,990
Looking at you makes it harder

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,280
But I know that you'll find another

19
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:31,890
That doesn't always make you want to cry

20
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,090
Started with a perfect kiss

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,360
Then we could feel the poison set in

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:45,570
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,310
You know that I love you so

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,900
I love you enough to let you go

25
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:05,140
I want you to know that it doesn't matter

26
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,220
Where we take this road

27
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,360
Someone's gotta go

28
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,760
And I want you to know

29
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,900
You couldn't have loved me better

30
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,090
But I want you to move on

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,230
So I'm already gone

32
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,660
I'm already gone, already gone

33
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,960
You can't make it feel right

34
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,270
When you know that it's wrong

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,050
I'm already gone, already gone

36
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,200
There's no moving on

37
00:02:47,250 --> 00:03:14,510
So I'm already gone

38
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,770
Remember all the things we wanted

39
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,070
Now all our memories, they're haunted

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,460
We were always meant to say goodbye
