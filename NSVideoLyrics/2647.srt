1
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,417
Don't pretend you're sorry

2
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,347
I know you're not

3
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:30,861
You know you got the power

4
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:33,633
To make me weak inside

5
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:38,061
Girl you leave me breathless

6
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:41,285
But it's okay 'cause

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,494
You are my survival

8
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:47,140
Now hear me say

9
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,160
I can't imagine life

10
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:52,882
Without your love

11
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:56,815
Even forever don't seem

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,366
Like long enough

13
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,662
'Cause everytime I breathe

14
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,827
I take you in

15
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:09,511
And my heart beats again

16
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:12,778
Baby I can't help it

17
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:13,674
You keep me

18
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,910
Drowning in your love

19
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:19,356
Everytime I try to rise above

20
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:22,916
I'm swept away by love

21
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:26,209
Baby I can't help it

22
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:27,148
You keep me

23
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:30,208
Drowning in your love

24
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:37,071
Maybe I'm a drifter

25
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:39,349
Maybe not

26
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:43,340
'Cause I have known the safety

27
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,219
Of floating freely

28
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:45,776
In your arms

29
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:50,880
I don't need another lifeline

30
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:53,052
It's not for me

31
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:56,794
'Cause only you can save me

32
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:59,847
Oh can't you see

33
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:02,428
I can't imagine life

34
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:05,635
Without your love

35
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,664
And even forever don't seem

36
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,971
Like long enough

37
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,294
'Cause everytime I breathe

38
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,566
I take you in

39
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,998
And my heart beats again

40
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:25,338
Baby I can't help it

41
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:26,523
You keep me

42
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:28,335
Drowning in your love

43
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,275
Everytime I try to rise above

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,944
I'm swept away by love

45
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,853
Baby I can't help it

46
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:39,833
You keep me

47
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,400
Drowning in your love

48
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:44,623
Go on and pull me under

49
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:48,063
Cover me with dreams, yeah

50
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:51,156
Love me mouth to mouth now

51
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:54,455
You know I can't resist

52
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,572
'Cause you're the air

53
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,645
That I breathe

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,152
'Cause everytime I breathe

55
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:02,467
I take you in

56
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:06,146
And my heart beats again

57
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:09,455
Baby I can't help it

58
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,002
You keep me

59
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:12,397
Drowning in your love

60
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:16,262
Everytime I try to rise above

61
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:19,489
I'm swept away by love

62
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:22,886
And baby I can't help it

63
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:23,539
You keep me

64
00:03:23,574 --> 00:03:32,130
Drowning your love

65
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:36,726
Baby I can't help it

66
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,539
Keep me drowning

67
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:40,100
In your love

68
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:43,238
I keep drowning

69
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:47,480
In your love

70
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:50,111
Baby I can't help it

71
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,087
Can't help it no, no

72
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,424
'Cause everytime I breathe

73
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,546
I take you in

74
00:03:56,581 --> 00:04:00,189
