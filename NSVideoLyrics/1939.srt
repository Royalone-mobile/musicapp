00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,190
I heard

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,950
That your settled down

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,570
That you found a girl

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,390
And your married now.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,190
I heard that your dreams came true.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,420
Guess she gave you things

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,630
I didn't give to you.

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:49,190
Old friend, why are you so shy?

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,140
It ain't like you to hold back

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,320
Or hide from the lie.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,200
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,

15
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,280
But I couldn't stay away,

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,750
I couldn't fight it.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,440
I hoped you'd see my face

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,220
And that you'd be reminded,

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,260
That for me, it isn't over.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,290
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,570
I wish nothing but the best for you too.

22
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,530
Don't forget me, I beg,

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,510
I remember you said:

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,690
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,070
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,200
Yeah.

27
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,700
You'd know how the time flies.

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:03,880
Only yesterday was the time of our lives.

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,200
We were born and raised in a summer haze.

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:18,660
Bound by the surprise of our glory days.

31
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,040
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,

32
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,980
But I couldn't stay away

33
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,790
I couldn't fight it

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,020

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

42
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,610
Yay-e.

43
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,420
Nothing compares, no worries or cares.

44
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,820
Regret's and mistakes

45
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,050
They're memories made.

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,620
Who would have known how

47
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,980
Bittersweet this would taste?

48
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:29,730
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.

49
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,260
I wish nothing but the best for you

50
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,610
Don't forget me, I beg

51
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,890

54
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:05,240
I wish nothing but the best for you too.

55
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,940
Don't forget me, I beg

56
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,170
I remembered you said

57
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,110
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,300
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

59
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,860
Yeah.
