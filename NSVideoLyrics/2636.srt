00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:36,292
Me and my boys went out,\N just to end up in misery

10
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:40,601
I was about to go home \Nand there she was standing in front of me

11
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:44,999
Said 'Hi, I got a little place nearby

12
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:48,323
Wanna go?', I should have said 'No'

13
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:51,923
Someone's waiting for me

14
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,455
But I called my girl up and said

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,339
