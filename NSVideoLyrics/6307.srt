1
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,600
watching the minute hand

2
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,560
frozen solid not moving

3
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,480
still we believe we can

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,580
but we're afraid of losing

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,760
watching from over here

6
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:41,840
its hardly worth competing

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,840
im almost out of here

8
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,890
while breaking a heart thats beating

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,890
just as i start giving up

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,850
im not backing up

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,420
run into the light

12
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,900
get out of your own way

13
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,520
not afraid to fight

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,950
believe in what you say

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,160
i'll hold on till the night

16
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,710
hanging by a thread

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,200
i'm not scared to let go

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,880
thoughts inside your head

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,320
that creep up to get you

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:28,120

21
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:38,720
so i'll hold on til the night

22
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,790
i climbed up on a tree

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,890
to get a new perspective

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,380
if love is worth the time

25
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,930
the price is being rejected

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,870
just as i start falling down

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,590
i turned this around

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,490
run into the light

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,910
