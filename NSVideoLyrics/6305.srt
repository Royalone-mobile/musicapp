1
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,570
I'm dressing up for tonight

2
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,550

4
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,510
We headed straight to the bar,

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,410
One drink became many more.

8
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,100
Moving, moving, and now the club is overcrowded.

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,160
And at the top of the night,

10
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,310
I caught her right in my sight.

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,080
I took a chance, chance.

12
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,690
She's cooler than ice.

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,550
Flyer than wind.

14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,520
Hotter than fire.

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,740
This is the night.

16
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,500

17
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,690
She's hotter than fire.

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,410

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,470

Her silhouette is death,

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,380
She's got me catching my breath.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,200
She's so advance-vanced, a-advance-vanced.

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,020
Moving, moving, I feel the vibe is getting loud, yeah.

33
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,890
Moving, moving, we're meant to be, no doubt about it.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,090
And at the end of the night,

35
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,060
I'm leaving right by her side.

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,000

Get up out your seat.
