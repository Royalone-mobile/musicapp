1
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,150
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,150
And I'm a house of cards

3
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,760
You're the kinda reckless that should send me running

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,230
But I kinda know I won't get far

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,870
And you stood there in front of me just

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,630
Close enough to touch

7
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,310
Close enough to hope you couldn't see

8
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,520
What I was thinking of

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,880
Drop everything now

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,320
Meet me in the pouring rain

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,300
Kiss me on the sidewalk

12
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,170
Take away the pain

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:05,640
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,500
Get me with those green eyes, baby

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,650
As the lights go down

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,870
Something that'll haunt me when you're not around

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:26,760
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,160
My mind forgets to remind me

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,890
You're a bad idea

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,160
You touch me once and it's really something

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,690
You find I'm even better than you

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,750
Imagined I would be

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,120
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,810
But with you I know it's no good

25
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:03,610
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,930
Drop everything now

27
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,130
Meet me in the pouring rain

28
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,420
Kiss me on the sidewalk

29
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,340
Take away the pain

30
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:20,790
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

31
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,570
Get me with those green eyes, baby

32
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,810
As the lights go down

33
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,990
And something that'll haunt me when you're not around

34
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:40,830
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,500
I run my fingers through your hair

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,040
And watch the lights go out

37
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,960
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,510
It's just strong enough to make you feel right

39
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,650
Lead me up the staircase

40
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,780
Won't you whisper soft and slow

41
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,700
I'm captivated by you baby

42
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,560
Like a firework show

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,180
Drop everything now

44
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,240
Meet me in the pouring rain

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,620
Kiss me on the sidewalk

46
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,260
Take away the pain

47
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:35,870
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

48
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,740
Get me with those green eyes, baby

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,880
As the lights go down

50
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,180
And something that'll haunt me when you're not around

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:57,040
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

52
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:03,490
Sparks fly, baby smile,

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,140
Sparks fly
