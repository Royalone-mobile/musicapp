1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:13,000
I can almost see it that dream I am dreaming

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,000
But there's a voice inside my head saying: "You'll never reach it"

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Every step I'm taking, every move I make feels

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,500
Lost with no direction, my faith is shaking

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,300
But I gotta keep trying

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,200
Gotta keep my head held high

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,300
Always gonna be an uphill battle

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,200
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,900
Ain't about how fast I get there

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,300
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,400
It`s the climb

13
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,110
The struggles I'm facing

14
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,410
the chances I'm taking

15
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,610
Sometimes might knock me down, but no, I'm not breaking

16
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,810
I may not know it

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,610
but these are the moments that

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm gonna remember most yeah

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,210
just gotta keep going
I'm gonna remember most yeah

20
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,500
just gotta keep going

21
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,810
And I, I gotta be strong

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,320
Just keep pushing on 'cause

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,320
There's always gonna be another mountain

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm always gonna wanna make it move

25
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,420
Always gonna be a uphill battle

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,420
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

27
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,020
Ain't about how fast I get there

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,320
It's the climb

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,320
   

31
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,020
There's always gonna be another mountain

32
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,330
I'm always gonna wanna make it move

33
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,430
Always gonna be an uphill battle

34
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,230
Sometimes You're gonna have to lose

35
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,230
Ain't about how fast I get there

36
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:00,030
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side

37
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,230
It's the climb

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,130
Keep on moving

39
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,630

40
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,730
Keep the faith, baby

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,240
It's all about, it's all about the climb

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,240
Keep the faith, keep your faith
