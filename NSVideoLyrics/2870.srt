on your lunch break, I think

71
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,080
And you always order the special,

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,440
with the hot chocolate

73
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,360
And my manager be tripping and stuff

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,080
Talking bout we gotta use water

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,840
But I always use some milk

76
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,720
and cream for you

77
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,760
Cause I think you're kinda sweet.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
Anyway you always got

79
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,840
on some fly blue suit

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,680
'n your cufflinks are shining all bright

I don't wanna waste your time but

85
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,200
I know girls don't usually do this,

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,360
But I was wondering if maybe

87
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,200
we could get together

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Outside the restaurant one day

89
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,880
Cause I do look a lot different

90
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,360
outside my work clothes

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,640
I mean we could just go across

92
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,680
the street to the park right here

93
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,600
Wait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin up,

94
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
