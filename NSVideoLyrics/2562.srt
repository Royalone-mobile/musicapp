1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:09,480

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:20,930
Yes I'm a whole lot of trouble baby,
like a kid in a candy store.

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,710
I've got nothin but trouble babe,
not since the day that I was born.

4
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,250
(Do your thang honey)

5
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,640
I could feel it from the start

6
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,320
Couldn't stand to be apart

7
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,020
Somethin bout ya caught my eye

8
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,660
Somethin moved me deep inside

9
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,630
I don't know what you did boy but you had it

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,070
And I've been hooked ever since

11
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,190
I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friends

12
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,090
Told the others, my lovers from past and present tense

13
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,450
That every time I see you everything starts making sense

14
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,700
(Do your thang honey)

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,100
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you

16
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,150
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do

17
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,650
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon

18
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,570
You got soul, you got class,
you got style with your bad ass

Ain't no other man but you

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,010
Never thought I'd be alright, no no no

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,840
Til you came and changed my life, yeah yeah yeah

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,140
What was cloudy now is clear, yeah yeah

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,700
You're the light that I needed

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,640
You got what I want boy and I want it

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,170
So keep on givin' it up

27
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,190
So tell your mother, your brother,
your sister and your friends

28
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,090
And the others, your lovers, better not be present tense

29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,250
Cause I want everyone to know that
you are mine and no one else's

30
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,100
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you

Talk me down from every ledge

43

Give me strength, boy you're the best

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,000
