1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,960
I can be tough

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,160
I can be strong

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,780
But with you, it's not like that at all

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,470
There's a girl that gives a shit

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,530
Behind this wall,

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,630
you just walk through it

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,870
And I remember all those crazy things you said

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,720
You left them running though my head

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,690
You're always there, you're everywhere

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,570
But right now I wish you were here

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,510
All those crazy things we did

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,340
Didn't think about it, just went with it

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,280
You're always there, you're everywhere

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,110
But right now I wish you were here

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,780
Damn, damn, damn

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,130
What I'd do to have you here,

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,480
here, here

18
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,910
I wish you were here

19
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,330
Damn, damn, damn

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,750
What I'd do to have you near,

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
near, near

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,430
I wish you were here

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,300
I love the way you are

24
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,470
It's who I am, don't have to try hard

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,790
We always say, say it like it is

26
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,040
And the truth is that I really miss

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,250
All those crazy things you said

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,180
You left them running though my head

29
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,970
You're always there, you're everywhere

30
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,010
But right now I wish you were here

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,850
All those crazy things we did

32
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,780
Didn't think about it, just went with it

33
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,610
You're always there, you're everywhere

34
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,550
But right now I wish you were here

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,250
Damn, damn, damn

36
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,440
What I'd do to have you here,

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,850
here, here

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,300

Damn, damn, damn

near, near

42
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,990
I wish you were here

43
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,200
No, I don't wanna let go,

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:36,220
I just wanna let you know
That I never wanna let go, let go, oh, oh

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,670
No, I don't wanna let go,

46
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:50,300
I just wanna let you know,
That I never wanna let go, let go,..

47
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,260
Damn, damn, damn

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,320
Damn, damn, damn

56
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,770
What I'd do to have you here,

57
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,060

I wish you were here
