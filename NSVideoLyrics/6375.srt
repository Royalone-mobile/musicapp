1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,880
I threw a wish in the well,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,810
Don't ask me, I'll never tell

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,710
I looked to you as it fell,

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,730
and now you're in my way

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,790
I trade my soul for a wish,

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,750
pennies and dimes for a kiss

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,780
I wasn't looking for this,

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,680
but now you're in my way

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,590
Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,650
Hot night, wind was blowin'

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,600
Where you think you're going, baby?

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,400
Hey, I just met you,

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,410
and this is crazy,

14
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,330
but here's my number,

15
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,650
so call me, maybe?

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,460
It's hard to look right,

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,320
at you baaaabeh,

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,450

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,420

And all the other boys,

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,350

26
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,330

29
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,890
You took your time with the call,

30
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,900
I took no time with the fall

31
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,820
You gave me nothing at all,

32
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,710
but still, you're in my way

33
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,810
I beg, and borrow and steal

34
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,820
Have foresight and it's real

35
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,870
I didn't know I would feel it,

36
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,750
but it's in my way

37
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,750
Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'

I missed you so bad

58
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,710
