[Katy Perry]
I know a place

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Where the grass is really greener

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,450
Warm, wet and wild

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,200
There must be something in the water

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,150
Sippin' gin and juice

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,750
Laying underneath the palm trees
(Undone)
