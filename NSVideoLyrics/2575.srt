1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,720
You know,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,520
Tonight I'm feeling a little out of control

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,180
Is this me? You want to get crazy?

4
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,570
'Cause I don't give a (Ow)

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm out of character, I'm in rare form

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,600
And if you really knew me

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,750
You'd know it's not the norm

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,930
Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,390
The old me's gone, I feel brand new

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,700
And if you don't like it, fuck you

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,820
The music's on and I'm dancing

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,650
I'm normally in the corner just standing

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,550
I'm feeling unusual

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,750
I don't care 'cause this is my night

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm not myself tonight

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,510
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:00,110
I'm not myself tonight

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,600
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
I'm dancing a lot and I'm taking shots

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,650
And I'm feeling fine

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,450
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,070
Someone call the doctor 'cause I lost my mind

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,000
Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,300
The old me's gone, I feel brand new

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,900
And if you don't like it, fuck you

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,000
The music's on and I'm dancing
And if you don't like it, fuck you

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,820
The music's on and I'm dancing

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,650
I'm normally in the corner just standing

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,550
I'm feeling unusual

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,750
I don't care 'cause this is my night

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,920
I'm not myself tonight

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,510
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

33
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,110
I'm not myself tonight

34
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,500
Tonight I'm not the same girl

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
(One, two, three, four)

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,500
In the morning, when I wake up

37
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:57,300
I go back to the girl I used to be

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,350
But baby, not tonight

39
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,520
I'm not myself tonight

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,110
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

41
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,710
I'm not myself tonight

42
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,200
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:26,100
    

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,000
That feels good, I needed that

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,450
Get crazy, let's go

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,600
That's right, come on

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Give it to me now

48
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,400
Don't stop
