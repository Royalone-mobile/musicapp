1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,660
You've got your mother and your brother

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,600
Every other undercover

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,410
Tellin' you what to say

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,790
You think I'm stupid

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,850
But the truth is

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,350
That it's cupid, baby

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,050
Lovin' you has made me this way

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,300
So before you point your finger

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,270
Get your hands off of my trigger

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,020
Oh yeah

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,270
You need to know this situation's getting old

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,890
And now the more you talk

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,080
The less I can say, oh

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,890
I'm looking for attention

15
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,950
Not another question

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,700
Should you stay or should you go?

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,080
Well, if you don't have the answer

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,580
Why you still standin' here?

19
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:07,990
Just walk away

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,680
I waited here for you

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,740
Like a kid waiting after school

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,360
So tell me how come you never showed?

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,930
I gave you everything

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,990
And never asked for anything

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,050
And look at me

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,990
I'm all alone

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,300
So, before you start defendin'

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,930
Baby, stop all your pretendin'

30
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,670
I know you know I know

31
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,670
So what's the point in being slow

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,680
Let's get the show on the road today

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,700
Hey

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,760
I'm looking for attention

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Not another question

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,700
Should you stay or should you go?

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,010
Well, if you don't have the answer

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,200
Why you still standin' here?

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,180
Hey, hey, hey, hey

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:05,990
Just walk away

41
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,110
I wanna a love

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,300
I want a fire

43
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,360
To feel the burn

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,300
My desires

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,340
I wanna a man by my side

46
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,460
Not a boy who runs and hides

47
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,960
Are you gonna fight for me?

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,090
Die for me?

49
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,340
Live and breathe for me?

50
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,960
Do you care for me?

51
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,360
'Cause if you don't then just leave

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,240
I'm looking for attention

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,360
Not another question

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,860
Should you stay or should you go?

55
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,360
Well, if you don't have the answer

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,740
Why you still standin' here?

57
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,670
Hey, hey, hey, hey

58
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,990
Just walk away

59
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,440
If you don't have the answer

60
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,940
Walk away

61
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,630
Just walk away

62
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:54,710
Then just leave

63
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:12,960
Walk away
