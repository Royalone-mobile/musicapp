Alicia Keys - No One

2
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,130
from the album "As I Am"

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:20,630
I just want you close

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,700
Where you can stay forever

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,350
You can be sure

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,480
That it will only get better

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,050
You and me together

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,730
Through the days and nights

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,110
I don't worry 'cause

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,100
Everything's gonna be alright

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,290
People keep talking

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,420
They can say what they like

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,730
But all I know is

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,160
Everything's gonna be alright

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,730
No one, no one, no one

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,790
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,420
No one, no one, no one

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,660
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

19
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:24,400
You, you

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,790
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,530
When the rain is pouring down

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,470
And my heart is hurting

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,030
You will always be around

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,160
Yes, I know, for certain

25
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,530
You and me together

26
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,410
Through the days and nights

27
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,850
I don't worry 'cause

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,780
Everything's gonna be alright

29
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,910
People keep talking

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,040
They can say what they like

31
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,350
But all I know is

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,790
Everything's gonna be alright

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,350
No one, no one, no one

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,410
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling

35
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,160
No one, no one, no one

36
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,350
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,720
You, you

38
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,100
Can get in the way of what I feel

39
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,980
I know, some people search the world

40
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,850
to find something like what we have

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,790
I know, people will try, try to divide

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,340
something so real

43
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,220
so 'till the end of time

44
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,730
I'm telling you that

45
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,790
No one, no one

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,780
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling

47
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:21,350
No one, no one, no one

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,090
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

49
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,970
Oh oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh oh ooh,

50
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,280
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oooh

51
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:44,030
Oh oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh oh ooh,

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:54,080
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oooh
