1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,800
I am done, smoking gun

2
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:30,101
We've lost it all, the love is gone

3
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:40,002
She has won, now it's no fun

4
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:48,813
We've lost it all, the love is gone

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,514
And we had magic, and this is tragic

6
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,820
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

7
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:19,321
I feel like our world's been infected

8
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:29,182
And somehow you left me neglected

9
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:38,670
We've found our lives been changed

10
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:45,071
Babe, you lost me

11
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:56,272
And we tried, oh, how we cried

12
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:05,003
We lost ourselves, the love has died

13
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:14,804
And though we tried you can't deny

14
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:24,105
We're left as shells, we lost the fight

15
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:36,206
And we had magic, and this is tragic

16
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:45,357
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself, oh

17
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:54,021
I feel like our world's been infected

18
00:02:55,202 --> 00:03:03,882
And somehow you left me neglected

19
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:13,370
We've found our lives been changed

20
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:19,171
Babe, you lost me

21
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:23,682
Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet

22
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:28,683
But you chose lust when you deceived me

23
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:33,584
And you'll regret it, but it's too late

24
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:38,205
How can I ever trust you again?

25
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:46,251
I feel like our world's been infected

26
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:56,112
And somehow you left me neglected

27
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:05,600
We've found our lives been changed, yeah

28
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:11,401
Babe, you lost me
