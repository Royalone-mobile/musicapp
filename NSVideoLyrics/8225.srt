1
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,820
Well I couldn't tell you why she felt that way

2
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,910
She felt it every day

3
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,810
And I couldn't help her

4
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,660
I just watched her make the same mistakes again

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,550
What's wrong, what’s wrong now?
Too many, too many problems

6
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,220
Don't know where she belongs,
where she belongs

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,660
She wants to go home, but nobody's home

8
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,360
That's where she lies, broken inside

9
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:09,810
With no place to go, no place to go,
to dry her eyes

10
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,860
Broken inside

11
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:22,910
Open your eyes and look outside,
find the reasons why

12
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:32,610
You've been rejected, and now you can't
find what you've left behind

13
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,510
Be strong, be strong now
Too many, too many problems

14
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,310
Don't know where she belongs,
where she belongs

15
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,660
She wants to go home, but nobody's home

16
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,310
That's where she lies, broken inside

17
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:01,510
With no place to go, no place to go,
to dry her eyes

18
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,810
Broken inside

19
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,360
Her feelings she hides
Her dreams she can't find

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,460
She's losing her mind
She's fallen behind

21
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,690
She can't find her place
She's losing her faith

22
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,210
She's falling from grace
She's all over the place

23
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,810
Yeah

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,810
She wants to go home, but nobody's home

25
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,610
That's where she lies, broken inside

26
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,810
With no place to go, no place to go,
to dry her eyes

27
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,810
Broken inside

28
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:01,810
She's lost inside, lost inside oh oh

29
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:11,910
She's lost inside, lost inside oh oh
