1
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:42,030
When the rain is blowing in your face,

2
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,390
And the whole world is on your case,

3
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,240
I could offer you a warm embrace

4
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,230
To make you feel my love.

5
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,130
When the evening shadows
and the stars appear,

6
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,340
And there is no one there to dry your tears,

7
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,470
I could hold you for a million years

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,420
To make you feel my love.

9
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:35,360
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,

10
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:41,540
But I would never do you wrong.

11
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,730
I've known it from the moment that we met,

12
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:55,110
No doubt in my mind where you belong.

13
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,370
I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,

14
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,590
I'd go crawling down the avenue.

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,610
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do

16
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:20,730
To make you feel my love.

17
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,500
The storms are raging on the rolling sea

18
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,570
And on the highway of regret.

19
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,600
Though winds of change are throwing
wild and free,

20
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,960
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.

21
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,270
I could make you happy,
make your dreams come true.

22
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,560
Nothing that I wouldn't do.

23
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,440
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,

24
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:50,490
To make you feel my love
