1
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:27,475
I've been around the world

2
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:31,117
Hey hey

3
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,560
I've been around the world

4
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,490
Hey hey

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,040
In the kitchen

6
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,100
Where I'm cooking

7
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,170
What is good for me?

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,200
Spices from the globe

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,430
Little by little

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,430
It's the finest meal

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,590
It's appetite for hope

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,710
Come and see

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,320
You mix it all together

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,590
In your dreams

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,140
Ingredients from the seven seas

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,580
And I'm realizing things ain't

17
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,100
What they seem

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,490
That's the riddle of it

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,180
That's the spirit of it

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,460
That's the power of life

21
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,990
I've been around the world

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,780
And I've seen it all

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,560
I've been around the world

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,430
The sun will always rise

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,260
And fall

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,620
I've been around the world

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,290
And I want you to see

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,070
I've been the only girl

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,390
All surrounded by mystery

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,870
In the living room

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,030
I'm cleaning up

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,650
From top to floor

33
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,830
The place I love the most

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,310
The wall is covered up with

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,060
All my souvenirs

36
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,830
I've got from coast to coast

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,310
Come and see

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,730
You mix it all together

39
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,170
In your dreams

40
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,750
Ingredients from the seven seas

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,110
And I'm realizing things ain't

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,850
What they seem

43
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,040
That's the riddle of it

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,790
That's the spirit of it

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
That's the power of life

46
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,480
I've been around the world

47
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,550
And i've seen it all

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,730
I've been around the world

49
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,020
The sun will always rise

50
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,720
And fall

51
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,420
I've been around the world

52
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,840
And I want you to see

53
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,020
I've been the only girl

54
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,850
All surrounded by mystery

55
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,300
I'm still coming around

56
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,820
I keep chasing dreams

57
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,680
Girl I keep coming around

58
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,500
Hey hey

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,660
I keep coming around

60
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,680
And I can never stop

61
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,470
Girl I keep coming around

62
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,770
Cause if I do I'll walk around

63
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,260
Around

64
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,020
Around

65
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,710
Around the world

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,420
I've been around the world

67
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,760
Hey hey

68
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,130

I've been around the world

73
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,860
The sun will always rise

74
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,410
And fall

75
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:51,460
Round the world
