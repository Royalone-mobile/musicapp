1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,560
You know I hate sleeping alone

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,730
But you said that you would soon be home

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,530
But baby that was a long time ago

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,180
I'm not feelin' it

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,860
On top of you not calling me back

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,060
You see I bet you think it's all on track

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,620
And you actin' like it's all a dat

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,340
I'm not feelin' it

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:33,360
I'm taking back the things I got from you(you)

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,410
And that includes my sweet little nooky too(too)

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,990

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,880
Let's go

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,190
Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat
