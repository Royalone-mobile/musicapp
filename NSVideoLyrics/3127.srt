1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,070
You, with your words like knives

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,140
And swords and weapons that you use against me

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,910
You,

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,220
Have knocked me off my feet again

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,020
Got me feeling like I'm nothing

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,700
You,

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,730
With your voice like nails on a chalkboard

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,920
Calling me out when I'm wounded

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,370
You, pickin' on the weaker man

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,890
You can take me down

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,740
With just one single blow

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,150
But you don't know, what you don't know

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,670
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,000
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

15
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:56,420
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,700
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,020
Why you gotta be so mean?

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,370
You, with your switching sides

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,500
And your walk by lies and your humiliation

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,490
You, have pointed out my flaws again

21
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,510
As if I don't already see them

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,910
I walk with my head down

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,250
Trying to block you out cause I'll never impress you

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,650
I just wanna feel okay again

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,220
I bet you got pushed around

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,240
Somebody made you cold

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,660
But the cycle ends right now

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,390
You can't lead me down that road

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,410
You don't know, what you don't know

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,050
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city

31
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,300
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

32
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,700
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

33
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,120
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

34
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,430
Why you gotta be so mean?

35
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,840
And I can see you years from now in a bar

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,860
Talking over a football game

37
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,610
With that same big loud opinion but

38
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,750
Nobody's listening

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,850
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things

40
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,710
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,030
But all you are is mean,

42
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,350
All you are is mean.

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,050
And a liar, and pathetic,

44
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,990
And alone in life,

45
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,510
And mean,

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,520
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city

47
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,890
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,930
Yeah

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,130
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

50
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,680
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

51
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,670
Why you gotta be so?

52
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,860
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,360
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

54
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,310
Why you gotta be so?

55
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,700
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

56
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,170
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

57
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,690
Why you gotta be so mean?
