1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,740
Young girl, don't cry

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:22,810
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,310
Young girl, it's all right

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,420
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,430
When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:49,340
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,130
No one ever wants or bothers to explain

8
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:02,750
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means

9
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,270
When there's no one else

10
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,210
Look inside yourself

11
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,270
Like your oldest friend

12
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,800
Just trust the voice within

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,040
Then you'll find the strength

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,890
That will guide your way

15
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,300
If you will learn to begin

16
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:35,740
To trust the voice within

17
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,570
Young girl, don't hide

18
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:51,560
You'll never change if you just run away

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,360
Young girl, just hold tight

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,830
And soon you're gonna see your brighter day

21
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:11,160
Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,960
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid

23
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:24,840
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,720
When you're lost outside look inside to your soul

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,190
When there's no one else

26
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,940
Look inside yourself

27
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,570
Like your oldest friend

28
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,580
Just trust the voice within

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,620
Then you'll find the strength

30
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,440
That will guide your way

31
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,650
If you will learn to begin

32
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,920
To trust the voice within

33
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,080
Life is a journey

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,610
It can take you anywhere you choose to go

35
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,760
As long as you're learning

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,530
You'll find all you'll ever need to know

37
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,070
You'll make it

38
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,320
Just don't go forsaking yourself

39
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,670
No one can stop you

40
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,300
You know that I'm talking to you

41
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,940
When there's no one else

42
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,720
Look inside yourself

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,930
Like your oldest friend

44
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,480
Just trust the voice within

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,540
Then you'll find the strength

46
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,640
That will guide your way

47
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,580
If you will learn to begin

48
00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:01,440
To trust the voice within

49
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,370
   

50
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,370
Young girl don't cry

51
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,870
I'll be right here when your world starts to fall
