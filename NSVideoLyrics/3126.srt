1
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:35,890
State the obvious,

2
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:38,500
I didn’t get my perfect fantasy

3
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:41,010
I realized you love yourself

4
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,182
More that you could ever love me

5
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:45,658
So go and tell your friends

6
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:48,112
That I’m obsessive and crazy,

7
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:49,011
That’s fine

8
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,511
You won't mind if I say 

9
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:54,116
And by the way

10
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:57,504
I hate that stupid old pickup truck,

11
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,893
You never let me drive

12
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:02,104
You’re a redneck, heartbreak

13
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:04,358
Who’s really bad at lying

14
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:07,256
So watch me strike a match

15
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,114
On all my wasted time

16
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:11,183
As far as I’m concerned,

17
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:14,385
You’re just another picture to burn.

18
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,186
There’s no time for tears

19
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,807
I’m just sitting here planning my revenge

20
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:24,874
There’s nothing stopping me

21
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,642
From going out \Nwith all of your best friends

22
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:31,813
And if you come around \Nsaying sorry to me

23
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:36,135
My daddy’s going \Nto show you how sorry you’ll be

24
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,583
‘Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck,

25
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:41,739
You never let me drive

26
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:44,123
You’re a redneck, heartbreak

27
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:46,926
Who’s really bad at lying, yeah

28
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:49,190
So watch me strike a match

29
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:51,072
On all my wasted time

30
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:53,248
As far as I’m concerned,

31
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:56,714
You’re just another picture to burn.

32
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:07,493
And if you’re missing me

33
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:10,264
You better keep it to yourself

34
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,268
‘Cause coming back around here

35
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:15,921
Would be bad for your health

36
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:19,463
‘Cause I hate \Nthat stupid old pickup truck,

37
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:21,714
You never let me drive

38
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:23,912
You’re a redneck, heartbreak

39
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:26,686
Who’s really bad at lying, yeah

40
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:28,903
So watch me strike a match

41
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:30,906
On all my wasted time

42
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:33,128
In case you haven’t heard,

43
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:37,658
I really, really hate \Nthat stupid old pickup truck,

44
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:39,818
You never let me drive

45
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:42,096
You’re a redneck, heartbreak

46
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:44,950
Who’s really bad at lying, yeah

47
00:02:44,985 --> 00:02:47,147
So watch me strike a match

48
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:49,165
On all my wasted time

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,265
As far as I’m concerned,

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,564
You’re just another picture to burn.

51
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:59,216
Burn, burn, burn, baby burn.

52
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:03,201
Just another picture to burn

53
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:08,881
Baby burn
