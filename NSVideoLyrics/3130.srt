1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,760
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,850
in the front seat of his car,

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,080
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,500
The other on my heart,

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,530
I look around, turn the radio down,

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,980
He says "Baby is something wrong?"

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,930
I say "Nothing, I was just thinking

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,390
How we don't have a song",

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,500
And he says...

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,980
Our song is the slamming screen door,

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,740
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,280
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,400
Cause it's late and your mama don't know,

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,550
Our song is the way you laugh,

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,690
The first date, man,

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,680
I didn't kiss her and I should have,

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,360
And when I got home before I said amen,

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,780
Asking God if he could play it again.

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,110
I was walking up the front porch steps

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,660
After everything that day,

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,520
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on,

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,490
And lost and thrown away,

23
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,060
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed,

24
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,570
I almost didn't notice all the roses,

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,360
And the note that said...

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,860
Our song is the slamming screen door,

27
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,800
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window,

28
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,140
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,440
Cause it's late and your mama don't know,

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,460
Our song is the way you laugh,

31
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,750
The first date, man,

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,580
I didn't kiss her and I should have,

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,330
And when I got home before I said amen,

34
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,480
Asking God if he could play it again.

35
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,880
I've heard every album, listened to the radio,

36
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,610
Waited for something to come along,

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,380
That was as good as our song...

38
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,580
Our song is the slamming screen door,

39
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window,

40
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,430
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,930
Cause it's late and your mama don't know,

42
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,020
Our song is the way you laugh,

43
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,210
The first date, man,

44
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,160
I didn't kiss her and I should have,

45
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,960
And when I got home before I said amen,

46
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:52,360
Asking God if he could play it again.

47
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,390
Play it again

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,410
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone,

49
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,430
In the front seat of his car,

50
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,790
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin,

51
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,830
And I... wrote down our song.
