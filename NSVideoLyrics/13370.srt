16
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,560
Your heart is unreliable

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,370
Something so sentimental

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,110

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,760

And your eyes are lock and key, to my heart

24
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,760
Tempting my confession

25
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,950
(my confession)

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,700

But you know i've got a boy somewhere
