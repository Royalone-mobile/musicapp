1
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,730
The cycle repeated

2
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,300
As explosions broke in the sky

3
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,660
All that i needed

4
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,530
Was the one thing i coudn't find

5
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,010
And you were there at the turn

6
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,320
Waiting to let me know

7
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,830
We're Building it Up

8
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,200
To break it back down

9
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,570
We're building it up

10
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,190
To burn it down

11
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,810
We can't wait

12
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,480
To Burn it to the ground

13
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,310
The colors conflicted

14
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,560
As the flames climb in to the clouds

15
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,730
I wanted to fix this

16
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,980
But coudn't stop from tearing it down

17
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:57,350
And you were there at the turn

18
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,840
Caught in the burning glow

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,030
And i was there at the turn

20
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,500
Waiting to let you know

21
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,900
We're Building it Up

22
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,260
To break it back down

23
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,570
We're building it up

24
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,320

We can't wait

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,500
To Burn it to the ground

27
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,060
You told me Yes, You held me high

28
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,180
And i believed when you told that lie

29
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,360
I played soldier, You played king

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,490
And struck me down when i kissed that ring

31
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,670
You lost that right, To hold that crown

32
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,850
I build you up but you let me down

33
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,920
So when you fall, I'll take my turn

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,500
and fan the flames and your blazes burn

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,720
And you were there at the turn

36
