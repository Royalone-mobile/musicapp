1
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,740
You drink more than you used to

2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,210
Fell in love how could you

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,990
Trust your heart like only fools do

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,530
Go on let it bleed

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,190
You smoked ten now it's twenty

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,840
Bet you wish you never met me

7
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,440
To stick around you must be crazy

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,160
Go on let it bleed

9
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,690
I told you never to get used to me

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,920
I still awake when you fall asleep

11
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,080
I'm a whole lot of trouble

12
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,660
We're in a whole lot of trouble

13
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,010
I told you you should never follow me

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,360
But here we are, and you're into deep

15
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,390
I'm a whole lot of trouble

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,290
We're in a whole lot of trouble

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,000
You shout louder than you used to

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,210
And you hold on tighter in the bedroom

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,870
Stick around like i'mma change soon

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,650
Go on let it bleed

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,940
As you stand there trying to save me

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,590
Use your head and babe believe me

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,000
Gonna take much more than a heart to save me

24
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,540
Go on let it bleed

25
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,830
I told you never to get used to me

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,860
I still awake when you fall asleep
I told you never to get used to me

27
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:59,630
I told you never to get used to me

28
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,590
I'm a whole lot of trouble
I still awake when you fall asleep

29
00:02:12,590 --> 00:03:04,390
I still awake when you fall asleep

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,550
We're in a whole lot of trouble
I'm a whole lot of trouble

31
00:02:18,550 --> 00:03:08,700
I'm a whole lot of trouble

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,960
I told you you should never follow me
We're in a whole lot of trouble

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:03:12,030
We're in a whole lot of trouble

34
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,240
But here we are, and you're into deep
I told you you should never follow me

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:03:18,760
I told you you should never follow me

36
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,150
I'm a whole lot of trouble
But here we are, and you're into deep

37
00:02:31,150 --> 00:03:23,100
But here we are, and you're into deep

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,580
We're in a whole lot of trouble
I'm a whole lot of trouble

39
00:02:37,580 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm a whole lot of trouble
