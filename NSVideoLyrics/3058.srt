1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,360
I got a big ego, (hahaha)

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,280
I’m such a big ego, (hahaha)

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,600

00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,790
So stroke my big, (hahaha), Ego,

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,030
I like to joke around a little bit but here we go,

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,860
Welcome to the wonderful world,

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,640
Of go play the earl coz,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,000
Everything I throw up, blow up,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,310
Talking to the girl,

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,940
She said, know what, grow up,

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,250
You nasty,

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,990
I don’t understand why they trippin’,

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,130
If you ask me,

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,500
Flow is just as nice as,

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
I admit the propane,

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,380
I just spit, probably,

18
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,030
Just raise the gas prices,

19
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,330
Everybody in the club,

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,750
Try and get as fresh as me,

21
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,450
What you want dog,

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,270
Trying to stay recession free,

23
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,590
And spit, refreshly,

24
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,200
When I rock the stadium,

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,780
You probably get sweaty,

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,290
You should bring a extra tee,

27
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,720
Now I’m standing next to Jay,

28
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,370
Who standing next to B,

29
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,690
You coulda been anywhere in the world,

30
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,930
But you’re here with me,

31
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,200
That’s good for ego,

32
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,190
Me and my ego,

33
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,770
And it go wherever we go,

34
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,410
My ego is my imaginary friend,

35
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,440
He was with me when I was only imagining,

36
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,370
I had dreams of the league,

37
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,910
One day I play Kobe,

38
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,930
I walk up the puff and he already know me,

39
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,540
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem,

40
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,630
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams,

41
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,420
And my ego,

42
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,060
It's on baby, let's get lost,

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,190
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss,

44
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,060
For real, want you to show me how you feel,

45
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,390
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal,

46
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,140
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart,

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,450
but you aint gonna need it.

48
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,140
I'd rather you open up my body.

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,560
And show me secrets.

50
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,510
You didnt know was inside,

51
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,770
No need for me to lie.

52
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,340
It's too big, it's too wide,

53
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,400
It's too strong, it won't fit,

54
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,460
It's too much, it's too tough,

55
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,280
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up,

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,280
He got a big ego, such a huge ego,

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,590
I love his big ego, it's too much,

58
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,420
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up,

59
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,600
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose,

60
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,730
You can leave with me or you could have the blues,

61
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,620
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident,

62
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,810
You decide when you find on what I'm working with,

63
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,460
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs,

64
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,210
Better yet them thighs,

65
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,100
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes,

66
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,030
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me,

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,550
It's too big, it's too wide,

68
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,520
It's too strong, it won't fit,

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,410
It's too much, it's too tough,

70
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,490
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up,

71
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,460
I got a big ego, such a huge ego,

72
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,790
But he love my big ego, it's too much,

73
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:17,530
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up,

74
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,730
It's too big, it's too wide,

75
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,730
It's too strong, it won't fit,

76
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,490
It's too much, it's too tough,

77
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,780
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up,

78
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,790
He got a big ego, such a huge ego,

79
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,810
I love his big ego, it's too much,

80
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,620
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up,

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,550
Ego so big, you must admit,

82
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,810
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch,

83
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,640
Ego so strong, if you ain't know,

84
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,430
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano.
