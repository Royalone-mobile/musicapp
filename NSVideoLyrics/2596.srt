1
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:20,912
I'm standin' on the bridge

2
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:23,162
I'm waitin' in the dark

3
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:27,284
I thought that you'd be here by now

4
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,222
There's nothing but the rain

5
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:32,546
No footsteps on the ground

6
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:36,993
I'm listening but there's no sound

7
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:42,883
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?

8
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,529
Won't somebody come take me home?

9
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:50,957
It's a damn cold night

10
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:55,919
I'm tryin' to figure out this life

11
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:58,283
Won't you take me by the hand?

12
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,921
Take me somewhere new

13
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:03,331
I don't know who you are

14
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:07,851
But I'm, I'm with you

15
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:12,539
I'm with you

16
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:15,217
Hmm hmm hmm

17
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:17,824
I'm looking for a place

18
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,071
I'm searching for a face

19
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:23,964
Is anybody here I know?

20
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:27,097
'Cause nothing's going right

21
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,505
And everything's a mess

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,217
And no one likes to be alone

23
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:39,285
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,200
Won't somebody come take me home?

25
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:47,630
It's a damn cold night

26
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:52,305

27

Oh, why is everything so confusing?

34
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,319
Maybe I'm just out of my mind

35
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:24,189
