Ay, Let me kick it
to you right quick, partner

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,710
Not as a ganster,
but as a grown man

3
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,350
What matters more than
the mistakes you've made

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,470
Is what you able
to learn from it.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,440
Big Phil
This for you pimpin'

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,910
I've been travellin' on
this road too long

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,250
Just tryna find
my way back home

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,090
The old me is dead and gone,
dead and gone

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,180
I've been travellin' on
this road too long

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,650
Just tryna find
my way back home

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,030
The old me is dead and gone,
dead and gone

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,850
Ever had one of dem days wish
woulda stayed home

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,650
Run into a group of suckas
who gettin' they hate on

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,460
You walk by
They get wrong

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,250
You reply then
things get blown

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,900
Way outta proportion
Way past discussion

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,850
Just you against them,
pick one then rush 'em

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,450
Figure you'll get dropped,
hell that's nuthin'

19
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,380
They don't wanna stop
there now they bussin'

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,060
Now you gushin',
ambulance rushin'

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,750
You to the hospital
with a bad concussion

22
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,540
Plus ya hit 4 times
Plus it hit ya spine

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,380
Paralyzed waist down
now ya wheel chair bound

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,080
Nevermind that now
you lucky to be alive

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,920
Just think it all started
you fussin' with 3 guys

26
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,660
Now ya pride in the way,
but ya pride is the way

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,380
You could mess around,
get shot, die anyday

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,350
People die everyday

29
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,260
All over nonsense, dirty money, dice
game, stash box contents

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,870
Could this be 'cos
of hip hop music?

31
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,800
Or did the ones with
the good sense not use it?

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,380
Usually people don't know
what to do

33
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,160
when their back against the wall so
they just start shootin'

34
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,080
For red or for blue
or for blo I guess

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,830
From Bankhead or
from your projects

36
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,560
No more stress, now I'm straight,
now I get it, now I take

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,570
Time to think,
before I make mistakes

38
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,880
just for my family's sake

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,630
That part of me
left yesterday

40
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,470
The heart of me
is strong today

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,260
No regrets
I'm blessed to say

42
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,110
The old me
dead and gone away

43
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,260
I've been travellin' on
this road too long

44
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,800
Just tryna find
my way back home

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,530
The old me is dead and gone
dead and gone

46
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,570
I've been travellin' on
this road too long

47
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,820
Just tryna find
my way back home

48
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,380
The old me is dead and gone
dead and gone

49
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,150
I ain't never been scared,
l lived through tragedy

50
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,980
Situation coulda been
dead lookin' back at it

51
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,750
Most of that stuff
didn't even have to happen

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,410
But you don't think about it
when you out there trappin'

53
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,140
In apartments, hangin',
smokin', and rappin'

54
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,000
Suckas start something,
next thing ya know we cappin'

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,880
Get locked up then
didn't even get mad

56
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,620
Now think about damn
what a life I had

57
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,530
Most of that stuff,
look back, just laugh

58
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,300
Some shit still
look back get sad

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,950
Maybe my homeboy
still be around

60
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,690
Had I not hit the sucka
in the mouth that time

61
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,380
I won that fight
l lost that war

62
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,220
I can still see my homie
walkin' out that door

63
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,940
Who'da thought
I'd never see Philant no more?

64
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,680
Got enough dead homies
l don't want no more

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,630
Cost a sucka his job
Cost me more

66
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,450
Should walked of and
take that loss for sure

67
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,190
Now think before
l risk my life

68
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,900
Take them chances
to get my stripe

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,630
Somebody put his hands
on me alright

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,540
Otherwise stand there
talk shit all night

71
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,050
'Cos I hit you,
you sue me,

72
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,110
I shoot you, get locked up,
who me?

73
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,660
No more stress, now I'm straight,
now I get it, now I take

74
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,770
Time to think,
before I make mistakes

75
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,150
just for my family's sake

76
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,880
That part of me
left yesterday

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,770
The heart of me
is strong today

78
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,590
No regrets
