1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,200
At last has come along

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:23,010
my lonely days over

3
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,410
and life is like a song

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,620
At last

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:47,480
the skies above are blue

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,320
well my heart was wrapped up in clover

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:08,360
the night I looked at you I found a dream

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,090
that I could speak to

9
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:21,210
a dream that I could call my own

10
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:29,410
I found a thrill to press my cheek to

11
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:36,990
a thrill that I have never known well

12
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,820
You smile

13
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,550
you smile

14
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:54,750
oh and then the spell will cast

15
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,530
and here we are in heaven

16
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:10,530
for you are mine at last
