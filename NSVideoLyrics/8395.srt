1
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,280
I probably shouldn't say this

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,160
But at times I get so scared

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,540
When I think about the previous

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,410
Relationship we've shared

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,870
It was awesome but we lost it

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:30,120
It's not possible for me not to care

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,500
Now we're standing in the rain

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,860
But nothing's ever gonna change

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,660
Until you hear, my dear

10
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:46,360
The 7 things I hate about you

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,740
Oh you

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,680
You're vain, your games, you're insecure

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,550
You love me, you like her

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,680
You make me laugh, you make me cry

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,870
I don't know which side to buy

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,530
Your friends they're jerks

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,350
And when you act like them, just know it hurts

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,300
I wanna be with the one I know

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:14,120
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,550
You make me love you

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,060
   

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,680
It's awkward and it's silent

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,680
As I wait for you to say

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,840
What I need to hear now

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Your sincere apology

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,090
And when yuu mean it, I'll believe it

27
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,400
If you text it, I'll delete it

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,030
Let's be clear

29
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,920
Oh I'm not coming back

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,050
You're taking 7 steps here

31
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,800
The 7 things I hate about you

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,110
You're vain, your games, you're insecure

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,990
You love me, you like her

34
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,050
You make me laugh, you make me cry

35
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,300
I don't know which side to buy

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,740
Your friends they're jerks

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,610
And when you act like them, just know it hurts

38
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,870
I wanna be with the one I know

39
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:11,860
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,180
You make me love you

41
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,690
And compared to all the great things

42
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,060
That would take too long to write

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,560
I probably should mention

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,370
The 7 that I like

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,060
The 7 things I like about you

46
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,250
Your hair, your eyes, you old Levi's

47
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,990
And when we kiss, I'm hypnotized

48
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,120
You make me laugh, you make me cry

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,180
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy

50
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,810
Your hand in mine

51
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,740
When we're intertwined everything's alright

52
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,810
I wanna be with the one I know

53
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:55,530
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do ooh

54
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,410
You make me love you
