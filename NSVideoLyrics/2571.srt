00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,290
Candy man, candy man

00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,200

00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,500
He had tattoos up and down his arm

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,170
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,950
He's a one stop jive, makes my panties drop

He took me to this cotton club on Hollywood & Vine

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,690
We drank champagne and we danced all night

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,420
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (a big surprise)

Well, by now I?m getting all bothered and hot

29
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,730
When he hits my mouth he really hits the spot

30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,030
He got lips like sugar cane, oh

Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine

54
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,770
Jane lost her grip and down she fell

55
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:15,770
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
