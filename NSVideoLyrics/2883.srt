1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,840
Easy come, easy go

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,680
That's just how you live

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,090
Oh, take it all but you never give

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,220
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,610
Had your eyes wide open

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,710
Why were they open

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,140
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,330
You tossed it in the trash, you did

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,030
To give me all your love is all I ever ask

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,940
Cause what you don't understand is

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,970
I'd catch a grenade for ya

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,390
Throw my hand on a blade for ya

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,810
I'd jump in front of a train for ya

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,980
You know I'd do anything for ya

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,420
Oh, whoa

16
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,390
I would go through all this pain

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,290
Take a bullet straight through my brain

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,810
Yes, I would die for you baby

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,180
But you won't do the same

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,990
No,

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,760
Black and blue

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,470
Beat me till I'm numb

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,430
Tell the devil I said hey

24
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,980
When you get back to where you're from

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,360
Mad woman, bad woman

26
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,120
That's just what you are

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,100
Yeah, you smile in my face

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,560
Then rip the breaks out my car

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,960
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,140
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did

31
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,920
To give me all your love is all I ever ask

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,880
Cause what you don't understand is

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,900
I'd catch a grenade for ya

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,370
Throw my hand on a blade for ya

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,640
I'd jump in front of a train for ya

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,840
You know I'd do anything for ya

37
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,260
Oh, whoa

38
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,270
I would go through all this pain

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,070
Take a bullet straight through my brain

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,640
Yes, I would die for you baby

41
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,960
But you won't do the same

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,190
If my body was on fire

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,850
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,240
You said you love me, you're a liar

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,420
Cause you never ever, ever did baby

46
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,750
But darling I'd catch a grenade for ya

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,860
Throw my hand on a blade for ya

48
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,150
I'd jump in front of a train for ya

49
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,530
You know I'd do anything for ya

50
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,620
Oh, whoa

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,810
I would go through all this pain

52
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,670
Take a bullet straight through my brain

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,190
Yes, I would die for you baby

54
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,580
But you won't do the same

55
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,330
No you won't do the same

56
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,770
You wouldn't do the same

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,920
You'd never do the same

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,160
No,
