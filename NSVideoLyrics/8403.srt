Hey hey, you you, I don't like your girlfriend

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,300
No way, no way, I think you need a new one

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,500
Hey hey, you you, I could be your girlfriend

You're so fine, I want you mine,

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,650
I think about you all the time,
you're so addictive

9
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,350
Don't you know what I can do
to make you feel alright?

You can do so much better

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,900
I think we should get together now

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
And that's what everyone's talking about

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,800

I know you talk about me
all the time again and again

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,010
So come over here and tell me
what I wanna hear

27
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,220
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,820
I don't wanna hear you say
her name ever again

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,820
Cause she's like so whatever

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,680
And you can do so much better
