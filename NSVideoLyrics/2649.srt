1
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,695
Looking at your picture

2
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,972
from when we first met

3
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:35,449
You gave me a smile that I could never forget

4
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:41,364
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night

5
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,731
Wrapped around your finger

6
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:49,026
Always in my mind

7
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:53,145
The days they blend 'cause we stayed up all night

8
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,858
Yeah, you and I were everything,

9
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:01,449
everything to me

10
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:05,317
I just want you to know

11
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:09,666
that I've been fighting to let you go

12
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,836
Some days I make it through,

13
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:19,417
and then there's nights that never end

14
00:01:19,452 --> 00:01:23,206
I wish that I could believe

15
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:27,703
that there's a day you'll come back to me

16
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:32,151
But still I have to say

17
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:37,805
I would do it all again,

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,710
just want you to know

19
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:43,530
All the doors are closing

20
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:45,704
I'm trying to move ahead

21
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:50,305
And deep inside I wish it's me instead

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,620
My dreams are empty from the day

23
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:58,045
The day you slipped away

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,848
I just want you to know

25
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:06,727
that I've been fighting to let you go

26
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:10,817
Some days I make it through,

27
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:15,944
and then there's nights that never end

28
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:19,977
I wish that I could believe

29
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:24,329
that there's a day you'll come back to me

30
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:28,680
But still I have to say

31
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:34,480
I would do it all again,

32
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:36,820
just want you to know

33
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,801
That since I lost you,

34
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,073
I lost myself

35
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:47,813
No, I can't fake it,

36
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:52,414
there's no one else

37
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:56,003
I just want you to know

38
00:02:56,038 --> 00:03:00,469
that I've been fighting to let you go

39
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:05,377
Some days I make it through,

40
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:10,329
and then there's nights that never end

41
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:14,395
I wish that I could believe

42
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,101
that there's a day you'll come back to me

43
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:24,709
But still I have to say

44
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:28,746
I would do it all again,

45
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:32,736
just want you to know
