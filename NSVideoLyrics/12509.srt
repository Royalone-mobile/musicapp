00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:13,372
To all my friends,

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,228
The night is young

3
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:16,988
The music’s loud.

4
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,902
They’re playing our song

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,516
Nowhere else that I belong

6
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:27,390
Then here with you …

7
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:40,772
Oh oh oh ...

8
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:44,172
Ain’t felt this good since I remember

9
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:47,820
This night got started when you entered

10
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:51,556
I hope we can get a little closer

11
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:55,451
Maybe even get to know your name

12
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:58,955
I wanna hear the music so loud

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,587
Get some drinks inside me right now

14
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:05,034
So baby let it go

15
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:06,739
You had me at hello

16
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:08,715
Let’s raise your glass and toast

17
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:10,498
DJ plays that once more.

18
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:12,298

Gonna see the sun before you know it

26
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:46,914
If you got some money, time to blow it

27
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,562
Girl, way you got me feeling so sick

28
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:53,057
Dancing the night away with you,

29
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:55,001
With you , with you

30
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:58,105
