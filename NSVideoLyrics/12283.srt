1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:22,100
These waters can get a little busy

2
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,960
But I got experience

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,770
Don't mind treking thru the storm

4
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,740
Long as I know that you're here with me baby

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,970
Shedding all your innocence

6
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,350
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,320
Until i'm in so deep, it's up to my waist

8
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,600
But I promise girl I ain't afraid

9
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,210
It's raining inside your bed

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,010
No parts are dry

11
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,080
Lovin makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs

12
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:13,210
And ever since we first met I knew that

13
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:28,520
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

14
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,290
Can't help it, no

15
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,100
I want you to feel me

16
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,260
Every little bit of me baby

17
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,760
I don't need a life saver

18
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,620
Baby going deeper ain't gonna kill me

19
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,290
And I know they are shagging for me

20
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,840
I see the walls are looking like they might precipitate

21
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,070
Until i'm in so deep, it's up to my waist

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,770
But I promise girl I ain't afraid no no

23
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,330
It's raining inside your bed

24
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,540
No parts are dry

25
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,210
Lovin makes you so wet, your legs, your thighs

26
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,770
And ever since we first met I knew that

27
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:37,460
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

28
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,320
I'll be inside when the tides are rolling baby

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,850
You'll be my place hide, all night all night babe

30
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,730
I'm not afraid to try

31
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,960
I knew i, don't mind playing in the rain

32
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:04,640
I was hoping that I get to take that dive

33
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,400
It's raining inside your bed (Its raining and I dont mind if Im fucking wet baby ohhh)

34
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,200
No parts are dry

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,910
Lovin makes you so wet, (so wet) your legs, your thighs

36
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,540
And ever since we first met I knew that

37
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:32,980
I, I knew I was ready baby to take that dive

38
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:44,250
