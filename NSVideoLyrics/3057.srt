1
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,580
Remember those walls I built

2
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,740
Well baby they're tumbling down

3
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,540
And they didn't even put up a fight

4
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,700
They didn't even make a sound

5
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,580
I found a way to let you in

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,660
But I never really had a doubt

7
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,700
Standing in the light of your halo

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,220
I got my angel now

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,620
It's like I've been awakened

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,620
Every rule I had you breakin'

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,580
It's the risk that I'm takin'

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,740
I ain't never gonna shut you out

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,100
Everywhere I'm looking now

14
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,100
I'm surrounded by your embrace

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,140
Baby I can see your halo

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,020
You know you're my saving grace

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,980
You're everything I need and more

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,340
It's written all over your face

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,180
Baby I can feel your halo

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,020
Pray it won't fade away

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:36,100
I can feel your halo (halo) halo (4x)

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,060
Hit me like a ray of sun

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,140
Burning through my darkest night

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,780
You're the only one that I want

25
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,820
Think I'm addicted to your light

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,900
I swore I'd never fall again

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,140
But this don't even feel like falling

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,660
Gravity can't forget

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,060
To pull me to the ground again

30
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,820
Feels like I've been awakened

31
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,100
Every rule I had you breakin'

32
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,020
The risk that I'm takin'

33
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,140
I'm never gonna shut you out

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,220
Everywhere I'm looking now

35
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm surrounded by your embrace

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,260
Baby I can feel your halo

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,940
Pray it won't fade away

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:36,020
I can feel your halo (halo) halo (4x)

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,300
Everywhere I'm looking now
