1
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,780
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us

2
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,260
How we met and sparks flew instantly

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,480
People would say 'They're the lucky ones'

4
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,620
I used to know my place was a spot next to you

5
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,020
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,700
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,720
A super complication, miscommunication

8
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,450
Has lead to fallout

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,710
Too many things that I wish you knew

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,430
So when your wall's up I can't break through

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,050
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,340
And we're not speaking

13
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,070
And I'm dying to know

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,130
Is it killing you like it's killing me?

15
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,990
And I don't know what to say

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,930
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down

17
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,000
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,810
Next chapter

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,690
How'd we end up this way?

20
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,480
Singing nervously, pulling up my clothes

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,460
And trying to look busy

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,420
And you're doing your best to avoid me

23
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,070
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,390
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,820
But you held your pride like you should've held me

26
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,540
I'm scared to see the ending

27
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,740
Why are we pretending this is nothing?

28
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,100
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,840
I've never heard silence quite this loud

30
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,460
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room

31
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,690
And we're not speaking

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,480
And I'm dying to know

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,510
Is it killing you like it's killing me?

34
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,460
And I don't know what to say

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,400
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,320
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,310
This is looking like a contest

38
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,400
Of who can act like they care less

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,500
But I liked it better when you were on my side

40
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,130
The battle's in your hands now

41
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,100
But I will lay my armor down

42
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,040
If you say you'd rather love than fight

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,470
So many things that you wish I knew

44
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,320
But the story of us might be ending soon

45
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,850
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room

46
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,170
And we're not speaking

47
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,020
And I'm dying to know

48
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,940
Is it killing you like it's killing me?

49
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,870
But I don't know what to say

50
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,870
Since the twist of fate and it all broke down

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,660
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

52
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,310
Now,

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,560
And we're not speaking

54
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,440
And I'm dying to know

55
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,360
Is it killing you like it's killing me?

56
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,410
I don't know what to say

57
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,310
Since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,430
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

59
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,800
The End
