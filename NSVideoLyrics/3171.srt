1
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:15,070
For whatever reason,

00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:20,380
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life

3
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:23,380

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,020
Those lips and your brown eyes (Oooh)

14
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:49,190
What would it take for you to just leave with me?

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,590
Not trying to sound conceited but

16
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:54,040
You and me were meant to be (Yeah Yeah)

17

Pull the girl off the dance floor

28
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,830
Whisper in ear

29
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:27,030
Must've said somethin' bout me (What you say)

36
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:43,100
What would it take for you to just leave with me?

37
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,950
Not trying to sound conceited

38

But meeting you was destiny

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,170
