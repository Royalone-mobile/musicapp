1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:12,120
Ay bay it won't end, won't end, won't end

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,720
Let´s talk about love

3
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,280
This is my love story

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,830
Boy meets girl and looks in her eyes

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,830
Time stands still and two hearts catch fire

6
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,950
Off they go rollercoaster ride

7
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,940
Up & down and around...

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,000
Twisted all out they minds

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,310
And then his friends

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,430
Said "its too soon to settle down"

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,370
And then her friends

12
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,610
Said "he's a playa, slow it down"

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,670
They couldn't be who they was

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,670
Cause it just seemed like love

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,060
Wasn't on they side

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,040
But this isn't ...

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,280
Just another love story

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Together we'll make history

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,270
I know because it's just too real

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,510
They'll be no end to our love story

21
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,760
And this ain't gon end up

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,270
Like that Casablanca movie...no

23
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,440
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,810
This is truly

25
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,500
Ours for the eternity

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,550
They'll be no end to our love story

27
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:46,220
Baby...

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,580
Chapter two...

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,710
When they meet up again

30
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,580
Second time around

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,070
See but they're just friends

32
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,380
But the feelings still strong

33
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,690
And it's been too long

34
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,810
To be trippin' like they ain't been missing

35
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,000
They on the phone like

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ay bay bay

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,320

00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,050
You might as well come thru

We can make it like it was

41
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,540
Just the two of us

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,480
Back up on that rollercoaster

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,990

44
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,910
Cause this isn't

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,220
Just another love story

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,960
Together we'll make history

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,960
I know because it's destiny

48

Baby...

56
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,340
Just when it seemed

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,220
Like all the odds

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,540
Were stacked against them

59
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,280
They came back stronger then before

60
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,210
Matter fact then some

61
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,020
Stronger then pride

62
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,040
Lookin' like them

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,270
Lookin' like her, lookin' like him

64

Stronger then hate

65

And the whole world too

66
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,950
