1
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,410
You held my hand and
walked me home,

2
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,020
I know

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,440
While you gave me that kiss,
it was something like this,

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,710
It made me go

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,170
You wiped my tears,
got rid of all my fears,

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,370
why did you
have to go?

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,840
Guess it wasn't enough
to take up some of my love

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,810
Guys are
so hard to trust

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,170
Did I not tell you
that I'm not like that

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,820
Girl the one
who gives it all away

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,060
Did you think that I was gonna
give it up to you,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,310
This time?

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,210
Did you think that it was something
I was gonna tell

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,030
And cry?

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,230
Don't try to
tell me what to do,

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,040
Don't try to
tell me what to say,

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,980
You're better
off that way

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,600
Don't think that you're charming
the fact that your arm

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,340
Is now
around my neck

20
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,240
Will get you in my pants
I'll have to kick your ass

21
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,090
And make you
never forget

22
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,740
I'm gonna ask you to stop.
Thought I liked you a lot,

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,770
but I'm really upset

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,070
Really upset

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,450
So get out of my head,
get off of my bed

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,380
yeah that's
what I said

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,770
Did I not tell you
that I'm not like that

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,320
Girl the one
who throws it all away?

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680
Did you think that I was gonna
give it up to you,

30
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,780
this time?

31
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,790
Did you think that it was something
I was gonna tell

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,620
And cry?

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,770
Don't try to
tell me what to do,

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,450
Don't try to
tell me what to say,

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,480
You're better
off that way

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,920
This guilt trip that
you put me on won't

37
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,830
Mess me up
I've done no wrong

38
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:40,380
Any thoughts of you and me
have gone away

39
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,630
Did you think that I was gonna
give it up to you,

40
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,820
this time?

41
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,800
Did you think that it was something
I was gonna tell

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,560
and cry?

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,790
Don't try to
tell me what to do,

44
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,600
Don't try to
tell me what to say,

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,610
You're better
off that way

46
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,010
Better off that way

47
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,500
I'm better
off alone anyway

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
