00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,260
Katy, do you take Alexander to be
a your lawfully wedded husband? 

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,580
I do.

00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,780
Alexander, do you take Katy to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

Nhacso Lyrics

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,380
You...
.

6
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,400
You...
...change your mind

7
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,530
Like a girl...
.

8
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,130
Like a girl...
...changes clothe

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,130
Yeah you...
.

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,130
Yeah you...
PMS

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,620
Like a bitch...
.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,460
Like a bitch...
...I would know

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,110
And you...
.

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,880
And you...
...overthink

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,840
Always speak...
.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,430
Always speak...
...cryptically

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,330
I should know...

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,010
...That you're no good for me

19
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,240
'Cause you're hot then you're cold

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,060
You're yes then you're no

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,840
You're in then you're out

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,650
You're up then you're down

23
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,490
You're wrong when it's right

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,340
It's black and it's white

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,160
We fight, we break up

26
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,160
We kiss, we make up

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,790
You don't really want to stay, no

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,400
But you don't really want to go-o

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,090
you're hot then you're cold

30
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,930
You're yes then you're no

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,650
You're in then you're out

32
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,750
You're up then you're down

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,860
We...
.

34
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,930
We...
...used to be...

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,810
...Just like twins...

36
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,400
...Just like twins...
...so in sync

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,550
The same...
.

38
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,060
The same...
...Energy

39
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,950
Now's a dead...
.

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,660
Now's a dead...
...battery

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,780
Used to laugh...
.

42
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,100
Used to laugh...
...'bout nothing

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,320
Now you're plain...
.

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,120
Now you're plain...
...Boring        ˜

45
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,110
I should know...
.

46
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,880
I should know...
...that you're not gonna change

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,680
'Cause you're hot then you're cold

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,410
You're yes then you're no

49
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,380
You're in then you're out

50
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,250
You're up then you're down

51
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,930
You're wrong when it's right

52
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,750
It's black and it's white

53
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,540
We fight, we break up

54
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,330
We kiss, we make up

55
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,210
You don't really want to stay, no

56
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,040
But you don't really want to go-o

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,510
you're hot then you're cold

58
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,330
You're yes then you're no

59
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,170
You're in then you're out

60
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,680
You're up then you're down

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:54,660
    

62
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,590
Someone call the doctor

63
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,260
Got a case of a love bi-polar...

64
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,810
...Stuck on a roller coaster...

65
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,760
...Can't get off this ride

66
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,240
You...
.

67
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,700
You...
...change your mind

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,750
Like a girl...
.

69
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,640
Like a girl...
...changes clothe

70
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,890
'Cause you're hot then you're cold

71
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,700
You're yes then you're no

72
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,420
You're in then you're out

73
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,180
You're up then you're down

74
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,100
You're wrong when it's right

75
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,900
It's black and it's white

76
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,570
We fight, we break up

77
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,520
We kiss, we make up

78
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,430
'Cause you're hot then you're cold

79
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,040
You're yes then you're no

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,010
You're in then you're out

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,680
You're up then you're down

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,650
You're wrong when it's right

83
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,420
It's black and it's white

84
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,010
We fight, we break up

85
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,920
We kiss, we make up

86
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,930
You don't really want to stay, no

87
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,540
But you don't really want to go-o

88

You're yes then you're no

90
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,690
You're in then you're out

91
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,560
You're up then you're down

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:15,000
   

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alexander, do you?

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
    

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I do.
