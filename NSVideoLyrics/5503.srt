1
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:11,629
I can't believe I had to see

2
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:15,928
The girl of my dreams cheating on me

3
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:19,919
The pain you caused has left me dead inside

4
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:23,858
I'm gonna make sure, you regret that night

5
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:27,328
I feel you close, I feel you breathe

6
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:29,686
And now it's like you're here

7
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:31,379
You're haunting me

8
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:35,375
You're out of line, you're out of sight

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,423
You're the reason that we started this fight

10
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:45,079
But I know,

11
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:47,524
I just gotta let it go,

12
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,699
I, should've known

13
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:56,591
I gotta learn to say goodbye now

14
00:00:56,626 --> 00:00:58,285
I throw my armour down,

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,742
And leave the battleground

16
00:01:00,777 --> 00:01:02,814
For the final time now,

17
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:08,692
I, I know.

18
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:11,429
I'm running from a warzone

19
00:01:11,464 --> 00:01:14,817
In our house, I hate that place,

20
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:19,135
Everywhere I walk I see your face

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,058
Try to erase a memory with a flame,

22
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:26,892
And hope I never see you again

23
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:30,378
Standing here, in this burning room,

24
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:34,716
You know the end could never come so soon,

25
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:36,533
It's clear to me,

26
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:38,233
The lies you use,

27
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:42,327
The ones that killed me ain't hurting you,

28
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:48,183
So I know,

29
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:50,482
I just gotta let it go,

30
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:55,574
I, should've known

31
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:59,458
I gotta learn to say goodbye now

32
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:01,412
I throw my armour down,

33
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,386
And leave the battleground

34
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,106
For the final time now,

35
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:11,157
I, I know.

36
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:14,080
I'm running from a warzone

37
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:18,629
I'm running from a warzone

38
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:22,569
I can't do this anymore

39
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:26,424
I'm running from a warzone

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,980
What are we fighting for?

41
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:39,709
I'm running from a warzone...

42
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:06,703
I know,

43
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:09,200
I just gotta let it go,

44
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:14,263
I, should've known

45
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:18,241
I gotta learn to say goodbye now

46
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:20,341
I throw my armour down,

47
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,400
And leave the battleground

48
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,839
For the final time now,

49
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:30,415
I, I know.

50
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,293
I'm running from a warzone
