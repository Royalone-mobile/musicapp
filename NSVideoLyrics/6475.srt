1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,380
The whole world

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,570
Feels a little bit more love

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,820
When Christmas comes

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,070
When Christmas comes

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,130
And everywhere that you go

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,190
People singing "Let It Snow"

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,880
And hanging up

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,880
That mistletoe

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,070
And me and you gonna have ourselves

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,320
A holiday

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,940
And we don't need nobody else

12
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,630
To celebrate

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,000
And we're gon' kiss our worries

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,320
And our cares away

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,130
I can't wait

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,190
Because this Christmas time

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,750
Get together

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,250
It's gonna be so nice

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,130
Better than ever

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,000
And baby you're the one

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,880
Special treasure

22
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,190
I can't wait to unwrap your love

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,500
Until Christmas comes

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,690
Oh baby...

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,570
So many souls hurt

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,130
So many don't have enough

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,820
When Christmas comes

28
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,070
When Christmas comes

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,320
But baby if you spread love

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,940
Someday it might be enough

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,570
To heal each other

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,820
One by one

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,750
And we gon' get together

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,690
And rejoice and pray

35
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,940
And we gon' help the world

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,820
Become a better place

37
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,440
And we gon' sing and shout

38
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,250
Because the savior reigns

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,820
So don't dismay

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,690
Because this Christmas time

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,880
Get together

42
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,190
It's gonna be so nice

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,880
Better than ever

44
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,570
Because this gift of love

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,500
Lasts forever

46
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,940
The Lord makes our hearts open up

47
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,880
Soon as Christmas comes

48
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,940
It's gon' be alright

49
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,880
When Christmas comes

50
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,320
Oh jingle all the way

51
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,380
Oh what fun, hmm

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,750
And we gon' reminisce about

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,130
The good old days

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,880
And we gon' laugh together as

55
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,320
The children play

56
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,690
And through the years is always

57
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,750
Gonna be this way

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,250
Come what may

59
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,940
Because this Christmas time

60
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,440
Get together

61
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,500
It's gonna be so nice

62
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,690
Better than ever

63
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,940
And baby you're the one

64
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,940
That I treasure

65
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,000
I can't wait to unwrap your love

66
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,570
When Christmas comes

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:19,870
Lalala dada dada dada dadada dada
