1
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,110
I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time

2
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,070
Know there was something that, and something that I left behind

3
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,230
When I leave this world,

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,340
I'll leave no regrets

5
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,510
Leave something to remember,

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,180
so they won't forget

7
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,500
I was here...

8
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,080
I lived,

9
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,250
I loved

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,850
I was here...

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,250
I did,

12
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,900
I've done,

13
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,640
everything that I wanted

14
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,410
And it was more than I thought it would be

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,950
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,130
I was here...

17
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,540
***

18
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,360
I want to say I lived each day, until I died

19
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,890
I know that I had something in, somebody's life

20
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,380
The hearts I have touched,

21
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,100
will be the proof that I leave

22
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,710
That I made a difference,

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,180
and this world will see

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,290
I was here...

25
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,200
I lived,

26
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,750
I loved

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,050
I was here...

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,350
I did,

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,910
I've done,

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,760
everything that I wanted

31
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,240
And it was more than I thought it would be

32
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,080
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

33
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,490
I was here...

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,010
I lived, I loved

35
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,390
I was here...

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,940
I did,

37
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,560
I've done,

38
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,300
everything that I wanted

39
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,150
And it was more than I thought it would be

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,870
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,100
I was here...

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,570
I just want them to know

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,120
That I gave my all,

44
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,800
did my best

45
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,780
Brought someone to hapiness

46
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,560
Left this world a little better just because...

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,540
I was here...

48
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,950
***

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,100
I was here...

50
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,720
I lived,

51
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,780
I loved

52
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,560
I was here...

53
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,190
I did,

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,420
I've done,

55
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,410
everything that I wanted

56
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,950
And it was more than I thought it would be

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,280
I will leave my mark so everyone will know

58
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,650
I was here...

59
