1
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,830
L-U-V Madonna

2
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,200
Y-O-U You wanna

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,510
I see you coming and I don’t wanna know your name

4
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,820
L-U-V Madonna

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,630
I see you coming and you’re gonna have to change the game

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,000
Y-O-U You wanna

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,430
Would you like to try?

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,930
Give me a reason why

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,170
Give me all that you got

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,920
Maybe you’ll do fine

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,730
As long as you don’t lie to me

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,790
And pretend to be what you’re not

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,280
Don’t play the stupid game

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,650
Cause I’m a different kind of girl

15
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,960
Every record sounds the same

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,770
You’ve got to step into my world

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,070
Give me all your love and give me your love

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,320
Give me all your love today

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,560
Give me all your love and give me your love

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,190
Let’s forget about time

21
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,620
And dance our lives away

22
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,240
L-U-V Madonna

00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,220
L-U-V Madonna

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,780
It’s right in front of you, now tell me what you’re thinking of

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,210
Y-O-U You wanna

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,330
In another place, at a different time

29
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,890
You can be my lucky star

30
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,700
We can drink some wine

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,130
Burgundy is fine

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,940
Let’s drink the bottle every drop

33
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,750
Don’t play the stupid game

34
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,990
Cause I’m a different kind of girl

35
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,490
Every record sounds the same

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,420
You’ve got to step into my world

37
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,350
Give me all your love and give me your love

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,910
Give me all your love today

39
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,160
Give me all your love and give me your love

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,650
Let’s forget about time

41
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,710
And dance our lives away

42
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,770
Give me all your love

43
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,650
Give me all your love boy

44
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,890
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy

45
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,330
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme

46
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,200
Cause it’s time for change, like a nickel or a dime

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,320
I’m roman, i’m a barbarian, i’m conan

Glad, no one gave you this

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,720
It’s super sonic, bionic, uranium hit

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,160
So I break ‘em off tricks

Let’s pray that it sticks

59
