00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,930
Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care

2
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,960
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there

3
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,050
'cause it's over

4
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,380
bet just wont be fair

5
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,730
darling,

6
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,480
gonna be a poor woman living on the street,

7
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,380
no food to eat,

8
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,600
cause i don't want no pie if i have to cry.

9
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,550
cause it's over

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,130
when you said goodbye!

11
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,870
all at once...

12
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,150
i had it all

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,770
but it doesn't mean anything

14
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,800
now that you're gone

15
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:02,000
from above seems i had it all

16
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:07,180
but it doesn't mean anything

17
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,430
since you're gone

18
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,580
now i see myself through different eyes,

19
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,320
it's no surprise!

20
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,410
being alone will make you realise

21
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,490
when it's over!

22
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,560
all in love is fair

23
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,310
I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there, I shoulda shoulda love is fair.

24
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,980
all at once...

31
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,390
I know I pushed you away

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,980
What can I do that would save our love

33
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,260
Take these material things

34
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,980
They don't mean nothing

35
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,960
