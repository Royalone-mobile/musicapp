1
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,020
It's so hypnotic

2
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,520
The way he pulls on me

3
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,140
It's like the force of gravity

4
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,890
Right up under my feet

5
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,380
It's so erotic

6
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,630
This feeling can't be beat

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,620
It's coursing through my whole body

8
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,710
Feel the heat

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,580
I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,200
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re

11
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,510
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,070
Here it comes

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,370
When I hear them 808 drums

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,620
It's got me singing

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,750
Hey, ey, ey, ey

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,570
Ey, ey, ey

17
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,320
Like a girl gone wild

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,070
A good girl gone wild

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,940
I'm like, hey, ey, ey, ey

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,810
Ey, ey, ey

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,560
Like a girl gone wild

22
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,180
A good girl gone wild

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,800
Girls they just wanna have some fun

24
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,610
Get fired up like smokin' gun

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,220
On the floor til the daylight comes

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,530
Girls they just wanna have some fun

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,780
A girl gone wild

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,530
A good girl gone wild

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,390
I'm like a girl gone wild

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,890
A good girl gone wild

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
The room is spinning

32
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,770
It must be the tanqueray

33
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm about to go astray

34
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,330
My inhibition's gone away

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,630
I feel like sinning

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,260
You got me in the zone

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,950
DJ play my favorite song

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,720
Turn me on

39
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,160
I got that burnin' hot desi-i-i-re

40
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,650
And no one can put out my fi-i-i-re

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,150
It's coming right down through the wi-i-i-re

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,860
Here it comes

43
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,520
When I hear them 808 drums

44
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,770
It's got me singing

45
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,200
Hey, ey, ey, ey

46

A good girl gone wild

53
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,310
Girls they just wanna have some fun

54
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,990
Get fired up like smokin' gun

I know, I know, I know

58
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,960
I shouldn't act this way

59
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,580
I know, I know, I know

60
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,140
Good girls don't misbehave

61
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,510
Misbehave

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,450
But i'm a bad girl, anyway

63
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,180
Forgive me

64
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,440
