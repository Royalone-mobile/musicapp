1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,578
She's just a girl and she's on fire

2
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:15,962
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway

3
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:20,906
She's living in a world and it's on fire

4
00:00:21,225 --> 00:00:25,823
Filled with catastrophe, but she know she can fly away

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,702
Oh, she got both feet on the ground

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,310
And she's burning it down

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,990
Oh, she got her head in the clouds

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,350
And she's not backing down

9
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,340
This girl is on fire

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:58,090
This girl is on fire

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,200
She's walking on fire

12
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,380
This girl is on fire

13
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,490
Looks like a girl but she's a flame

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,060
So bright she can burn your eyes

15
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,620
Better look the other way

16
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,550
You can try but you'll never forget her name

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,860
She's on top of the world

18
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,540
Hottest of the hottest girls say

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,180
Oh, we got our feet on the ground

20
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,860
And we're burning it down

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,600
Oh, got our head in the clouds

22
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,900
And we're not coming down

23
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,080
This girl is on fire

24
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,640
This girl is on fire

25
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,630
She's walking on fire

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,000
This girl is on fire

27
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,860
Everybody stands as she goes by

28
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,300
Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes

29
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,920
Watch her when she's lighting up the night

30
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,540
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,530
And it's a lonely world

32
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,090
But she gon' let it burn baby burn baby

33
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,080
This girl is on fire

34
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,880
This girl is on fire

35
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,940
She's walking on fire

36
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,300
This girl is on fire

37
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:37,920
Oh, oh, oh...

38
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:50,780
She's just a girl, and she's on fire
