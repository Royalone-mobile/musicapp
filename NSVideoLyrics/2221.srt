00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,010
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,230

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,960
Hey, hey, hey,

I love the way you're standing

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,620
Lips look so sweet, like cotton candy (My love)

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,010
That don't mean you gotta stop dancing

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,670
'Cause the way that you move
is so demanding (My love)

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,050
Let's put it on cruise control

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,600
Let me take you to the crib,
let me ease your soul (My love)

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,180
I gonna take it really nice and slow

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,170
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:01:04,590
My love, hey, my love, hey

16
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,110
Walk into my great place, cozy

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm glad you came, let's make a toast (My love)

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,070
Let me make an indecent proposal

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,640
Let me take you to the back and
do what we're suppose to (My love)

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,120
Let's take a trip to the bayou

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,660
You can be the investigator, I'm your Private I (My love)

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,130
You know I want a piece of that pie

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,110
But first let me, let me, let me talk to her

24
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:33,920
My love, hey, my love, hey

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ain't another woman that can take your spot my-

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:50,350
   

27
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,440
If I wrote you a symphony,

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,060
Just to say how much you mean to me

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,400
(what would you do?)

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,310
If I told you you were beautiful

31
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,950
Would you date me on the regular

32
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,590
(tell me, would you?)

33
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,260
Well, baby I've been around the world

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,350
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)

35
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,530
This ring here represents my heart

36
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,880
But there's just one thing I need from you

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,640
(say "I do")

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,040
Yeah, because

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,070
I can see us holding hands

40
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,220
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand

41
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,850
I can see us on the countryside

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,260
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

43
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,040
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,150
Girl, you amaze me

45
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,680
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
See, all I want you to do is be my love

47
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,640
(So don't give away) My love

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
(So don't give away)

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,710
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

50
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,610
(So don't give away) My love

51
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,660
(So don't give away)

52
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,520
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,740
Ooooh, girl

54
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:10,140
My love

55
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,300
Now, if I wrote you a love note

56
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,030
And made you smile with every word I wrote

57
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,530
(what would you do?)

58
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,200
Would that make you want to change your scene

59
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,960
And wanna be the one on my team

60
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,180
(tell me, would you?)

61
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,240
See, what's the point of waiting anymore?

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,810
Cause girl I've never been more sure

63
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,750
(that baby, it's you)

64
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,570
This ring here represents my heart

65
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,750
And everything that you've been waiting for

66
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,580
(just say "I do")

67
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,030
Yeah, because

68
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,060
I can see us holding hands

69
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,130
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand

Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

72
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,950

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,140
Girl, you amaze me

74
