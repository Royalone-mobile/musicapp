1
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,280
I hopped off
the plane at LAX.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,490
With my dreams
in the cart again.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,260
Welcome to
the land of fame XX.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,720
Am I gonna fit in?

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,080
Jumped in the cab.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,800
Here I am for
the first time.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,290
Look to the right and
I see the hollywood sign.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,260
This is all
so crazy.

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,830
Everybody
seems so famous.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,680
My tummys turnin'
and I'm feelin' kinda home sick.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,600
Too much pressure
and I'm nervous.

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,260
'Cause when the taxi man
turned on the radio.

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,490
And a Jay Z's song was on.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,210
And a Jay Z's song was on.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,430
And a Jay Z's song was on.

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,450
So I put my hands up.
There playing my song.

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,760
And the butterflys
fly away.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,240
Noddin'

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,470
I got my hands up
there playing my song.

21
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,840
I know
I'm gonna be okay.

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,980
It's a
party in the USA.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,730
It's a
party in the USA.

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,220
Get to the club
in my taxi cab.

25
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,680
Everybodys
lookin' at me now.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,310
Like "whos that chick,

27
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,550
"She gotta be
from out of town".

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,750
So hard with my girls
not around me.

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,210
It's definatel
not a Nashville party.

30
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,380
'Cause' all
I see are stilletos.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,640

I never got the memo.

32
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,650
My tummys turnin'
and I'm feelin' kinda home sick.

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,550
Too much pressure
and I'm nervous.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,250
And the D.J.

35
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,510
And a Britney's song was on.
