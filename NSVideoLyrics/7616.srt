1
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:13,572
Cold as ice

2
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,972
And more bitter than a december

3
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,332
Winter night

4
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:22,324
That's how I treated you

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,524
And I know that I

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,492
I sometimes tend to loose my temper

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,011
And I cross the line

8
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:33,883
Yeah that's the truth

9
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:37,124
I know it gets hard sometimes

10
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:40,604
But I could never

11
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:42,995
Leave your side

12
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,651
No matter what I say

13
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:47,684
Coz if I wanted to go

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,124
I woulda gone by now but

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,740
I really need you near me

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,139
To keep my mind off the edge

17
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,411
If I wanted to leave

18
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:01,147
I woulda left by now

19
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:04,316
But you're the only one that knows me

20
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:10,316
Better than I know my self.

21
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:14,643
All along

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,907
I tried to pretend it didn't matter

23
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:20,388
If I was alone

24
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:23,149
Deep down I know

25
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:25,708
If you were gone

26
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:32,053
For even a day I wouldn't know which way to turn

27
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,932
Coz I'm lost without you.

28
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,316
I know it gets hard sometimes

29
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:41,580
But I could never

30
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:44,164
Leave your side

31
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,917
No matter what I say

32
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,797
Coz if I wanted to go

33
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,548
I woulda gone by now but

34
00:01:50,732 --> 00:01:53,756
I really need you near me

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,300
To keep my mind off the edge

36
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,292
If I wanted to leave

37
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:02,269
I woulda left by now

38
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:05,381
But you're the only one that knows me

39
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:11,548
Better than I know my self.

40
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:16,165
I get kind of dark

41
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:19,549
Let it go to far

42
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:23,084
I can be obnoxious at times

43
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:25,148
But try and see my heart

44
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:28,484
Cause I need you now

45
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:31,700
So don't let me down

46
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:34,653
You are the only thing in this world

47
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,468
I would die without

48
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,260
Coz if I wanted to go

49
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,548
I woulda gone by now but

50
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:43,420
I really need you near me

51
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:47,796
To keep my mind off the edge

52
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,997
If I wanted to leave

53
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,085
I woulda left by now

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,652
But you're the only one that knows me

55
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:59,932
Better than I know my self.

56
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:01,860
Coz if I wanted to go

57
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:03,860
I woulda gone by now but

58
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,317
I really need you near me

59
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:11,044
To keep my mind off the edge

60
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,884
If I wanted to leave

61
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:15,292
I woulda left by now

62
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,196
But you're the only one that knows me

63
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:24,092
Better than I know my self.
