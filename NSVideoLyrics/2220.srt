1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,200
She's freaky
and she knows it

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,120
She's freaky
and I like it

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,580
Listen

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,480
She grabs the
yellow bottle

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,920
She likes the way
it hits her lips

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,560
She gets to
the bottom

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,370
It sends her
on a trip so right

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,980
She might be goin' home
with me tonight

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,360
She looks like a model

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,610
Except she's got
a little more ass

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,290
Don't even bother

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,170
Unless you've got
that thing she likes

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,900
I hope she's goin' home
with me tonight

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,410
Those flashing lights come
from everywhere

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,110
The way they hit her I just
stop and stare

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,260
She's got me
love stoned

17
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,010
Man I swear she's
bad and she knows

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,750
I think that
she knows

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,080
She's freaky
and she knows it

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,030
She's freaky,
but I like it

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,920
She shuts the room down

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,110
The way she walks
and causes a fuss

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,780
The baddest in town

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,950
She's flawless
like some uncut ice

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,870
I hope she's goin' home
with me tonight

26
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,720
And all she wants
is to dance

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,910
That's why you'll find
her on the floor

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,670
But you don't
have a chance

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,670
Unless you move
the way that she likes

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,970
That's why she's goin' home
with me tonight

31
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,020
Those flashing lights come
from everywhere

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,800
The way they hit her
I just stop and stare

33
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,620
She's got me love stoned

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,330
Man I swear she's bad
and she knows

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,800
I think that she knows

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,940
Those flashing lights seem
to cause a glare

37
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,310
The way they hit her
I just stop and stare

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,420
She's got me love stoned
from everywhere

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,200
She's bad and she knows

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,890
I think that she knows

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,830
Now dance

42
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,360
Little girl

43
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,490
You're freaky,
but I like it

44
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,660
Hot damn!

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,070
Let me put my funk on
this one time

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,530
Those flashing lights
come from everywhere

47
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,400
The way they hit her
I just stop and stare

48
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,870
She's got me love stoned

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,740
Man I swear she's
bad and she knows

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,310
I think that she knows

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,260
Those flashing lights seem
to cause a glare

52
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,300
The way they hit her
I just stop and stare

53
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,820
She's got me love stoned
from everywhere

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,600
She's bad and she knows

55
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,150
I think that she knows

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,520
Those flashing lights come
from everywhere

57
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,770
The way they hit her
I just stop and stare

58
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,580
She's got me
love stoned

59
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,950
I think
I'm love stoned

60
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,160
She's got me
love stoned

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,950
I think that she knows,
think that she knows, oh, oh

62
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,070
Those flashing lights come
from everywhere
I think that she knows,
think that she knows, oh, oh

63
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,060
Those flashing lights come
from everywhere

64
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,510
The way they hit her
I just stop and stare

65
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,890
I'm love stoned from everywhere
and she knows

66
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,380
Think that
she knows, oh, oh

67
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,280
And now I walk
around without a care

68
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,990
She's got me hooked

69
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,640
It just ain't fair, but I...

70
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,370
I'm love stoned
and I could swear

71
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,810
That she knows

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,720
Think that
she knows, oh, oh

73
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,610
She knows,
she knows, oh, oh
