1
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,860
Everybody's talkin'

2
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,870
But they don't say a thing

3
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:17,520
They look at me with sad eyes

4
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:20,890
but I don't want the sympathy

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,730
It's cool you didn't want me

6
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:28,470
Sometimes you can't go back

7
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:34,380
Why'd you have to go and make a mess like that?

8
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,860
Well I Just have to say

9
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,550
Before I let go...

10
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,560
 

11
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:44,810
Have you ever been low?

12
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:49,900
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?

13
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,120
When the truth came out

14
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,460
Were you the last to know?

15
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,800
Were you left out in the cold?

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,070
What you did was low

17
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,340
 

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,700
No I don't need your number

19
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,070
There's nothing left to say

20
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:16,820
'Cept I never thought it'd hurt this much to be safe

21
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,200
My friends are outside waiting

22
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:23,120
I've gotta go

23
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:24,370
 

24
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:27,570
Have you ever been low? (have you ever been)

25
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:32,500
Have you ever had a friend let you down so?

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,760
When the truth came out

27
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:39,150
Were you the last to know?

28
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,400
Were you left out in the cold?

29
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,940
'Cause what you did was low

30
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:49,170
What you did was low

31
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:52,480
What you did was low

32
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:55,980
What you did was low

33
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,540
 

34
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,790
I walk out of this darkness

35
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,240
With no sense of regret

36
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:06,720
And I'm going on precautious

37
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,810
We both know that you can't say that

38
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:12,000
This to show

39
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:17,190
For all the time I loved you so

40
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,510
So...

41
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,090
Have you ever been low? (have you ever been)
