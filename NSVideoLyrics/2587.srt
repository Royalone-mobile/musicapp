1
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,810
Tripping out

2
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,730
Spinning around
I'm underground

3
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,150
I fell down,

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,110
Yeah,
I fell down

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,860
I'm freaking out

6
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,800
Where am I now?
Upside down

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,370
And
I can't stop it now

8
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:59,490
It can't stop me now

9
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:10,200
I'll get by,

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,070
I'll survive,

11
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,580
When the world's
crashing down

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,550
When I fall
and hit the ground

13
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,550
I will turn
myself around

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,150
Don't you try
to stop me

15
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,510
I won't cry

16
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:44,470
I found myself
in wonderland

17
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:53,760
Get back on
my feet again

18
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,370
Is this real?

19
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,790
Is this pretend?

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:10,660
I'll take a stand
until the end

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,670
I'll get by,

22
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,700
I'll survive,

23
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,160
When the world's
crashing down

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,090
When I fall
and hit the ground

25
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,060
I will turn
myself around

26
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,850
Don't you try
to stop me

27
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:43,190
I won't cry

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,620
I'll get by,

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,800
I'll survive,

30
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,450
When the world's
crashing down

31
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,370
When I fall
and hit the ground

32
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,320
I will turn
myself around

33
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,100
Don't you try
to stop me

34
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:15,400
I won't cry

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
