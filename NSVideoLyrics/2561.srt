1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,800
Don't look at me

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,540
Everyday is so wonderful

3
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,600
Then suddenly

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,160
It's hard to breathe

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,890
Now and then I get insecure

6
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,820
From all the pain

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,380
I'm so ashamed

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,180
I am beautiful

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,380
No matter what they say

10
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:04,180
Words can't bring me down

11
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,670
I am beautiful

12
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,790
In every single way

13
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,160
Yes words can't bring me down

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,100
Ohh no

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:32,500
So don't you bring me down today

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,370
To all your friends you're delirious

17
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,620
So consumed

18
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,420
In all your doom, ooh

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,040
Trying hard to fill the emptiness

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040
The pieces gone

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,590
Left the puzzle undone

22
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,840
Ain't that the way it is

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,460
'Cause you are beautiful

24
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,460
No matter what they say

25
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,950
Words can't bring you down

26
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,500
Ohh no

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,120
'Cause you are beautiful

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
In every single way

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,680
Yes words can't bring you down

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,490
Ohh no

31
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,170
So don't you bring me down today

32
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,100
No matter what we do

33
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,660
(No matter what we do)

34
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,540
No matter what we say

35
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,040
(No matter what we say)

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,660
We're the song inside the tune

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,530
(Yeah, oh yeah)

38
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,090
Full of beautiful mistakes

39
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,890
And everywhere we go

40
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,640
(And everywhere we go)

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,640
The sun will always shine

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,570
(The sun will always, always, shine)

43
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,510
And tomorrow we might awake

44
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,570
On the other side

45
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,000
'Cause we are beautiful

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,990
No matter what they say

47
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,420
Yes words won't bring us down

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,050
Ohh no

49
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,610
We are beautiful

50
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,600
In every single way

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,280
Yes words can't bring us down

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,090
Ohh no

53
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,890
So don't you bring me down today

54
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:31,060
Ooh, ohh

55
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:42,550
Don't you bring me down today

56
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,290
Don't you bring me down, ooh

57
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:58,290
Today
