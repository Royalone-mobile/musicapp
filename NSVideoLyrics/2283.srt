1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,950
Grew up in a small town

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,950
And when the rain would fall down

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,950
I just stared out my window

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,950
Dreaming of a could-be

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,950
And if I'd end up happy

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,950
Trying hard to reach out

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,950
But when I'd try to speak out

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,950
Felt like no one could hear me

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,950
Wanted to belong here

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,950
But something felt so wrong here

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,950
So I pray (I would pray)

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,950
I could breakaway

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,950
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,950
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,950
I'll make a wish

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,950
Take a chance

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,950
Make a change

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,950
And breakaway

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,950
Out of the darkness and into the sun

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,950
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,950
I'll take a risk

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,950
Take a chance

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,950
Make a change

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:31,950
And breakaway

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,950
Wanna feel the warm breeze

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,950
Sleep under a palm tree

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,950
Feel the rush of the ocean

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,950
Get onboard a fast train

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,950
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,950
And breakaway

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,950
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,950
I'll do what it takes til' I touch the sky

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,950
I'll make a wish

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,950
Take a chance

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,950
Make a change

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,950
And breakaway

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,950
Out of the darkness and into the sun

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,950
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,950
I'll take a risk

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,950
Take a chance

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,950
Make a change

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,950
Buildings with a hundred floors

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,950
And breakaway

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,950
Swinging around revolving doors

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,950
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,950
Gotta keep moving on, moving on

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,950
Fly away, breakaway

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,950
I'll spread my wings

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,950
And I'll learn how to fly

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,950
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,950
Take a chance

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,950
Make a change

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,950
And breakaway

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,950
Out of the darkness and into the sun

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,950
But I won't forget the place I come from

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,950
I gotta take a risk

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,950
Take a chance

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,950
Make a change

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,950
And breakaway, breakaway, breakaway

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,950
This is my first time to do such a job,

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
thank you for your use!
