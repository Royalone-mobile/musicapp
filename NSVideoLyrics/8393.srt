1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,600
You gotta help me out

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,800
It's all a blur last night

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,600
We need a taxi

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,800
'Cause you're hung over and I'm broke

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,200
I lost my fake ID

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,400
But you lost the motel key

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,400
Spare me your freaking dirty looks

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,100
Now don't blame me

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,000
You wanna cash out

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And get the hell outta town

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,300
Don't be a baby

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,000
Remember what you told me

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,500
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,100
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,700
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,300
Why are these lights so bright?

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,500
Did we get hitched last night?

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,600
Dressed up like Elvis

20
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,310
Why am I wearing your class ring?


21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,010
Don't call your mother

22
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,010
'Cause now we're partners in crime

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,310
Don't be a baby

24
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,310
Remember what you told me

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,500
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,100
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,700
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

29
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,500
You got me into this

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,200
Information overload, situation lost control

31
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,900
Send out an S.O.S.

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,310
Ha, and get some cash out

33
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,010
We're gonna tear up the town

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,810
No, don't be a baby

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,810
Remember what you told me

36
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:16,010
Remember what you told me

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,210
Told me, told me

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,900
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,900
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,500
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,100
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,500
That's what you get, baby

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
Shake the glitter

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,000
Shake, shake, shake the glitter

45
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,810
Gimme some cash out, baby

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,710
Gimme some cash out, baby
