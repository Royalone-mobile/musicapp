1
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,190
Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,750
You've got too much talent

3
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,960
I see you through those bloodshot eyes

4
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,480
There's a cure, you've found it

5
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,370
Slow motion Sparks you caught that chill

6
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,020
Now don't deny it

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,040
But boys will be boys Oh, yes they will

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,590
They don't want to define it

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,660
Just give up the game And get into me

10
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,370
If you're looking for thrills

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,080
Then get cold feet

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,120
Oh no, I do not hook up, up

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,160
I go slow, so if you want me

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,870
I don't come cheap

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,500
Keep your hand on my hand

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,660
And your heart on your sleeve

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,370
Oh no, I do not hook up, up

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,420
I fall deep, cuz the more that you try

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,770
The harder I'll fight to say goodnight

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,690
I can't cook, no

21
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,560
But I can clean up the mess she left

22
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,630
Lay your head down and feel the beat

23
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,270
As I kiss your forehead

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,010
This may not last but this is now

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,870
So love the one you're with

26
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,860
You wanna chase, but you're chasing

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,500
Your tail, quick fix

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,290
Won't ever get you well

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,110
Oh no, I do not hook up, up

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,180
I go slow, so if you want me

31
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,710

Keep your hand on my hand

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,590
And your heart on your sleeve

34

I fall deep, cuz the more that you try

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,870
The harder I'll fight to say...

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,990
Cuz I feel the distance between us

38
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:38,860
Could be over with a snap of your fingers

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,140
Oh, no

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,870
Oh no, I do not hook up, up

41
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,060
I go slow, so if you want me

42
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,540
I don't come cheap

43
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,220
Keep your hand on my hand

44
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,260
And your heart on your sleeve

45

I fall deep, cuz the more that you try

47
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,010
The harder I'll fight to say,

48
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,850
Cuz the more that you try

49
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,810
The harder I'll fight to say goodnight

50
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,720
Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down

51
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,640
Cause you don't wanna miss out
