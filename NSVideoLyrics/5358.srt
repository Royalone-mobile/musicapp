1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,420
Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed

2
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,450
Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,700
I tore it apart

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,730
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,100
And no woman in the world deserves this

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,760
But here I am asking you for one more chance

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,410
Can we fall, one more time?

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,680
Stop the tape and rewind

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,580
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,540
Cause there is nobody else

11
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,820
It's gotta be you

12
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,920
Only you

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,080
It's got to be you

14
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:18,350
Only you

15
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,620
Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles

16
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,530
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,380
You've almost had enough

18
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,500
And your actions speak louder than words

19
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,030
And you're about to break from all you've heard

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,880
Don't be scared, I ain't going no where

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,600
I'll be here, by your side

22
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:57,110
No more fears, no more crying

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,980
But if you walk away

24
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,830
I know I'll fade

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,620
Cause there is nobody else

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,950
It's gotta be you

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,050
Only you

28
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,820
It's got to be you

29
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,410
Only you

30
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,700
Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?

31
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,490
One more, one more, can we try?

32
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,350
One more, one more time

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,080
I'll make it better

34
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,880
One more, one more, can we try?

35
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,040
One more, one more,

36
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,720
Can we try one more time to make it all better?

37
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,360
Cos its gotta be you

38
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:15,250
Its gotta be you

39
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,400
It's gotta be you

40
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,620
Only you

41
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,640
It's gotta be you

42
00:03:32,690 --> 00:04:50,950
Only you!
