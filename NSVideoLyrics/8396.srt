1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,900
Bye guys!
See ya!

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,660
What did you think?

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,570
I was actually really surprised I really liked it.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,550
- Me too.
- Did you?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,320
Yea, I loved it.
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,350
   

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,350
Are you OK?

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:26,970
   

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,850
Miley, come here. Just want a couple of shots.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,970
Come on, just a couple...come back here. Come here!

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:41,690
   

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,110
You don't understand
what it is

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,490
That makes me tick

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,260
But you wish
you did

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,540
You always second guess,
wonder if

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,420
I say yes,
but you just lose out every time

17
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,930
If you only knew
what I talked about

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,320
When I'm with my friends
just hangin' out

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,370
Then you'd have
the inside scoop

20
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,410
On what to say,
what to do

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,180
That way
when you play the game

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,650
Maybe you could
never lose

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,830
Don't you wish that
you could be a Fly on the Wall?

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,220
A creepy little sneaky
little Fly on the Wall

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,120
All my precious secrets,
yeah

26
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,640
You'd know them all

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,010
Don't you wish that
you could be a Fly on the Wall?

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,720
You'd love to know,
the things I do

29
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,150
When I'm with my friends,
and not with you

30
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,370
You always second guess,
wonder if

31
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,140
There's others guys
I'm flirting with

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,530
You should know
by now

33
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,970
If you were my boyfriend,
I'd be true to you

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,350
If I make a promise,
I'm comin' thru

35
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,390
Don't you wish that you could
See me every second of the day

36
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,940
That way you would
have no doubt

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,610
That baby
I'll never stray

38
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,890
Don't you wish that
you could be a Fly on the Wall?

39
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,150
A creepy little sneaky
little Fly on the Wall

40
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,120
All my precious secrets,
yeah

41
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,610
You'd know them all

42
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,890
Don't you wish that
you could be a Fly on the Wall?

43
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,680
A little communication

44
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,500
Well that'll
go a long way

45
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,270
You're getting
misinformation

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,330
Too much hearsay,
hearsay

47
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,080
And what I say is

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,440
Come a little closer

49
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,000
And what
I'm gonna say is

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,790
Don't cha

51
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,080
Don't cha

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,220
Don't cha

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,500
Don't you wish you were a

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,990
Hey!

55
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,110
Don't you wish that
you could be a Fly on the Wall?

56
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,550
A creepy little sneaky
little Fly on the Wall

57
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,430
All my precious secrets,
yeah

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,970
You'd know them all

59
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,320
Don't you wish that
you could be a Fly on the Wall?

60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,280
You would not believe this craziest thing happened.
All these paparazzis and they would not quit chasing me.

61
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,580
They were dancing and I'm not sure why, but they were.

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,820
And it was absolutely amazing but still really weird.

63
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,030
And they kept coming after me and
I really could not escape from them.

64
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,350
Every time one thing I did, they would multiply.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,770
And it was so shrieked I just could not escape.

66
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,250
I was out in the ceilings.

67
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,560
I was everywhere and I could not get away from these guys.

68
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,880
It was insane.
