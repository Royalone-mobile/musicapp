1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,110
I gotta find my way back

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,930
Back to summer paradise

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,190
Sean Paul, Simple Plan

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,690
My heart is sinking

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,050
As I'm lifting up

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,840
Above the clouds away from you

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,880
And I can't believe I'm leaving

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,120
Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,270
But someday

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,390
I will find my way back

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,310
To where your name

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,080
Is written in the sand

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,960
Cause I remember every sunset

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,010
I remember every word you said

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,120
We were never gonna say goodbye

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,690
Singing la-la-ta-ta-ta

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,220
Tell me how to get back to

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,200
Back to summer paradise with you

19
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,880
And I'll be there in a heartbeat (heartbeat)

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,050
Oh-oh

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,380
I'll be there in a heartbeat (heartbeat)

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,280
Oh-oh

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,650
(Tell 'em)

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,550
My soul is broken

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,320
Streets are frozen

26
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,510
I can't stop these feelings melting through

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,450
And I'd give away a thousand days, oh

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,010
Just to have another one with you

29
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,630
(What'd you say)

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,520
Where real life can wait

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,470
(It can wait)

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,500
We're crashing my waves

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,360
(Uh-huh)

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,140
Playing in the sand

35
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,080
(Me and you)

36
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,770
Holding your hand

37
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,090
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,560
Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,610
I remember every word you said

40
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,250
We were never gonna say goodbye

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,970
Singing la-la-ta-ta-ta

42
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,760
Tell me how to get back to

43
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,800
Back to summer paradise with you

44
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,040
And I'll be there in a heartbeat (heartbeat)

45
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,400
Oh-oh

46
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,510
I'll be there in a heartbeat (heartbeat)

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,100
Oh-oh

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,880
Someday

49
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,120
I will find my way back

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,600
To where your name

51
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,530
Is written in the sand

52
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,010
Cause I remember every sunset (I remember)

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,760
I remember every word you said

55
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,330
We were never gonna say goodbye (no, no, no)

56
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,170
Singing la-la-ta-ta-ta

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,150
Tell me how to get back to (back to)

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,470
Back to summer paradise with you

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,480
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

60
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,910
I remember where we first kissed (I remember)

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,320
How I didn't wanna leave your lips

62
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,910
And how I've never ever felt so high (so high)

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,490
Singing la-la-ta-ta-ta

64
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,610
So tell me how to get back to (back to)

65
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,860
Back to summer paradise with you

66
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,490
And I'll be there in a heartbeat (heartbeat)

67
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh-oh

68
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,310
I'll be there in a heartbeat

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,020
(Summer paradise) Oh-oh

70
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,430
I'll be there in a heartbeat
