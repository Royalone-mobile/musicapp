1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,450
What if I told you it was all meant to be

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,950
Would you believe me

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,950
Would you agree

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,550
It's almost that feeling we met before

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,950
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,950
When I tell you love has come here and now

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,950
A moment like this

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,450
Some people wait a lifetime

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,450
For a moment like this

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,850
Some people search forever

11
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,750
For that one special kiss

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,450
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:10,250
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,050
Everything changes but beauty remains

15
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,050
Something so tender

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,850
I can't explain

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,950
Well I may be dreaming but till I awake

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,050
Can we make this dream last forever

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,350
And I'll cherish all the love we share

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,150
A moment like this

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,550
Some people wait a lifetime

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,650
For a moment like this

23
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,050
Some people search forever

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,850
For that one special kiss

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,350
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:11,450
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,450
Could this be the greatest love of all

28
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:24,250
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall

29
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,050
So let me tell you this

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:37,150
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,750
Some people wait a lifetime

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,750
For the moment like this

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,150
Some people search forever

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,850
For that one special kiss

35
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,350
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:06,250
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

37
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,950
Oh Oh like this

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,150
Oh Oh Oh Oh

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,150
I can't believe it's happening to me

40
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:35,150
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:46,550
Oh like this
