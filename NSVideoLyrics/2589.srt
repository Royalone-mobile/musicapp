1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,750
There's not much
going on today

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,410
I'm really bored,
it's getting late

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,820
What happened
to my Saturday?

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,540
Saturday

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,340
Monday's coming,
the day I hate

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,370
Sit on the bed alone,
staring at the phone

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,870
He wasn't what I wanted,
what I thought, no

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,310
He wouldn't even
open up the door

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,390
He never made me feel
like I was special

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,960
He isn't really what
I'm looking for

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,250
Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,240
This is when I start
to bite my nails

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,910
And clean my room
when all else fails

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,250
I think it's time
for me to bail

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,850
This point of view
is getting stale

16
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,820
Sit on the bed alone,
staring at the phone

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,320
He wasn't what I wanted,
what I thought, no

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,760
He wouldn't even
open up the door

19
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,730
He never made me feel
like I was special

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,340
He isn't really what
I'm looking for

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,890
Hey hey hey hey

22
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,420
Hey hey hey hey

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,380
Na na na na na,
we've all got choices

24
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,780
Na na na na,
we've all got voices

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,290
Na na na na na,
stand up make some noise

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,790
Na na na na,
stand up make some noise

27
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,870
Sit on the bed alone,
staring at the phone

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,160
He wasn't what I wanted,
what I thought, no

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,720
He wouldn't even
open up the door

30
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,690
He never made me feel
like I was special

31
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,240
He isn't really what
I'm looking for

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,160
He wasn't what I wanted,
what I thought, no

33
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,850
He wouldn't even
open up the door

34
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,510
He never made me
feel like I was special

35
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,170
Like I was special,
cause I was special

36
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,260
Na na na na

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,500
