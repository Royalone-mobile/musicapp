1
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,028
I don't want a lot for Christmas

2
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:41,093
There is just one thing I need

3
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:44,348
And I don't care about the presents

4
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:47,456
Underneath the Christmas tree

5
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,700
I don't need to hang my stocking

6
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:54,261
There upon the fireplace

7
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:57,228
Santa Claus won't make me happy

8
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:00,294
With a toy on Christmas Day

9
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:03,477
I just want you for my own

10
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:06,629
More than you could ever know

11
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:09,860
Make my wish come true

12
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,814
All I want for Christmas

13
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,927
Is you

14
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,646
Oh I won't ask for much this Christmas

15
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:25,869
I won't even wish for snow

16
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:29,198
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting

17
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,247
Underneath the mistletoe

18
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:35,493
I won't make a list and send it

19
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,678
To the North Pole for Saint Nick

20
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:42,317
I won't even stay awake to

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,086
Hear those magic reindeer click

22
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:48,302
'Cause I just want you here tonight

23
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,453
Holding on to me so tight

24
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,294
What more can I do?

25
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:59,422
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you

26
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:04,308
You

27
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:07,822
Oh all the lights are shining

28
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,702
So brightly everywhere

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,880
And the sound of children's

30
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,719
Laughter fills the air

31
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:20,664
And everyone is singing

32
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,872
I hear those sleigh bells ringing

33
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,679
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?

34
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,855
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

35
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:33,096
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas

36
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:36,254
This is all I'm asking for

37
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,743
I just want to see my baby

38
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,662
Standing right outside my door

39
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:45,863
Oh I just want you for my own

40
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:49,055
More than you could ever know

41
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:52,308
Make my wish come true

42
00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:58,222
Baby all I want for Christmas is

43
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:02,289
You baby

44
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:11,089
All I want for Christmas is you baby
