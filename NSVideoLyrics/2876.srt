1
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,850
Weren't you the one who said that

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,020
you don't want me anymore

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,200
and how you need your space,

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,680
and give the keys back to your door

5
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,610
and how I cried and tried and tried

6
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,280
to make you stay with me

7
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,470
but still you said the love was gone

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,030
and that I had to leave

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,700
(Now you)

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,440
talking 'bout a family,

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,320
(Now you)

12
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,240
sayin' I complete your dream

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,910
(Now you)

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,150
sayin' I'm your everything

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,950
you're confusing me what you say to me

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,810
don't play with me, don't play with me

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,550
Cause what goes around comes around

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,410
what goes up must come down

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,200
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back to me

20
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,810
what goes around comes around

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,610
what goes up must come down

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,710
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,570
I remember when I was sitting home alone

24
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,430
waiting for you 'til 3 o'clock in the morn

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,300
and when you came home

26
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,160
you'd always have some sorry exscuse

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,690
and explainin' to me, like I'm just some kinda fool

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,420
I sacrifie the things I want to just to do things for you

29
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,780
and when it's time to do for me

30
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,020
you never come through

31
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,700
(Now you)

32
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,680
want to be a bond of me (eyy)

33
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,300
(Now you)

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,220
have so much to say to me (heyy)

35
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,960
(Now you)

36
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,200
want to make time for me

37
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,560
What you do to me

38
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,990
You're confusin' me

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,160
Don't play with me, don't play with me

40
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,890
Cause what goes around comes around

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,750
what goes up must come down

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,850
Now who's crying desiring to come back to me

43
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,090
what goes around comes around

44
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,950
what goes up must come down

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,050
Now who's cryin', desirin' to come back

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,980
I remember when I was sittin' home alone

51
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,160
never thought you'd be the one that would decieve me

52
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,280
and never do what you're supposed to do

53
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,080
no need to hose me fool, 'cause I'm over you

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,750
Cause what goes around comes around
