1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,590
Nothing seems to be the way

2
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,840
That it used to

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,690
Everything seems shallow

4
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,310
God give me truth

5
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,090
In me

6
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,200
And tell me somebody's watching

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,220
Over me

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,190
And that is all I'm praying is that

9
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,460
Someday I will understand

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,520
In God's whole plan

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,270
And what He's done to me

12
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:10,510
Oh but maybe someday I will breathe

13
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,940
And I'll finally see

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,710
I'll see it all in my baby

15
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,720
Don't you run too fast my dear

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,570
Why don't you stop?

17
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,680
Just stop and listen to your tears

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,160
They're all you've got

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,580
It's in you

20
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,160
You see somebody's watching

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,090
Over you

22
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,110
And that is all I'm praying is that

23
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,440
Someday you will understand

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,450
In God's whole plan

25
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,240
And what He does to you

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,480
Oh but maybe someday you will breathe

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,900
And you'll finally see

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:21,330
You'll see it all in your baby

29
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:28,310
No moment will be more true

30
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:35,570
Than the moment I look at you

31
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,150
It's in you

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,600
You see somebody's watching

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,640
Over you

34
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,650
And that is all i'm praying is that

35
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,950
Someday you will understand

36
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,010
In God's whole plan

37
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,750
And what He does to you

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,040
Oh but maybe someday you will breathe

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,430
And you'll finally see

40
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:33,990
You'll see it all in your baby
