1
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,960
If I had no more time

2
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,970
No more time left to be here

3
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,600
Would you cherish what we have

4
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,570
Cause I'm everything that you were looking for

5
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,940
If I couldn't feel your touch

6
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,690
And no longer were you with me

7
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,880
I'll be wishing you were here

8
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,820
To be everything that I've been looking for

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,400
I don't want to forget the present is a gift

10
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,550
And I don't want to take for granted the time you may have here with me

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:34,210
Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed, so

12
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,770
Everytime you hold me

13
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,850
Hold me like this is the last time

14
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,300
Everytime you kiss me

15
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,350
Kiss me like you'll never see me again

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,880
Everytime you touch me

17
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,770
Touch me like this is the last time

18
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,520
Promise that you'll love me

19
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,110
Love me like you'll never see me again

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,290
How many really know what love is

21
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,490
Now you never will

22
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,900
Do you know until you lose it

23
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,190
That it's everything that we are looking for

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,610
When I wake up in the morning

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,360
With you beside me

26
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,900
I'm so thankful that I found

27
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,300
Everything that I've been looking for

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,850
I don't want to forget the present is a gift

29
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:04,180
And I don't want to take for granted the time you may have here with me

30
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,960
Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed, so

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,180
Everytime you hold me

32
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,180
Hold me like this is the last time

33
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,710
Everytime you kiss me

34
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,830
Kiss me like you'll never see me again

35
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,250
Everytime you touch me

36
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,180
Touch me like this is the last time

37
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,800
Promise that you'll love me

38
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:47,850
Love me like you'll never see me again
