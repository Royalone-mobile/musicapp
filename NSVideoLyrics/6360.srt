1
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:17,759
You come around to every child in the world

2
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:24,023
Always on time you're never late, every year

3
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,887
How does it feel to work, everyone's off, no one to help you

4
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:36,794
How do you reach us all, it's for sure, no one does it better

5
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:39,874
Christmas is finally here

6
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:42,593
It's time to celebrate

7
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:48,618
'Cause you make a better world, year after year

8
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,466
Soon you'll be on your way

9
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:54,418
Spreading joy everywhere

10
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,954
There's no one like you

11
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:00,866
Santa, you are the one

12
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:08,817
You creep down the chimneys at night, that's right

13
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:15,250
And you always know who has been naughty or nice

14
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:21,473
How does it feel to work, everyone's off, no one to help you

15
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,753
How do you reach us all, it's for sure, no one does it better

16
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,942
Christmas is finally here

17
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:33,766
It's time to celebrate

18
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:39,942
'Cause you make a better world, year after year

19
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,638
Soon you'll be on your way

20
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,606
Spreading joy everywhere

21
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:48,247
There's no one like you

22
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,079
Santa you are the one

23
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,797
Thank you Santa, thank you (You are the one)

24
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,438
Don't go Santa, don't go (You are the one)

25
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:59,871
Thank you Santa, thank you (You are the one)

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,809
Don't go santa, don't go (You are the one)

27
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:06,510
I hope you enjoy this song

28
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,784
It's a gift from everyone

29
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:15,287
Thank you for all that you have done

30
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:30,942
Christmas is finally here

31
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,789
It's time to celebrate

32
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:39,822
'Cause you make a better world, year after year

33
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,869
Soon you'll be on your way

34
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:45,606
Spreading joy everywhere

35
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,310
There's no one like you

36
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,134
Santa you are the one

37
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,458
You are the one

38
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:20,946
Santa, you are the one

39
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:24,114
You are the one

40
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,874
Santa, you are the one

41
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:28,706
You are the one

42
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:31,626
I said, you are the one
