1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,840
I hope the ring

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,030
You gave to her

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,770
Turns her finger green

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,160
I hope when you're in bed

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,660
With her

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,410
You think of me

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,950
I would never wish

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,760
Bad things

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,700
But I don't wish you well

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,070
Could you tell

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,080
By the flames

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,260
That burned your words

13
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,390
I never read your letter

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,640
Coz I knew what you'd say

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
Give me that

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,200
Sunday school answer

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,310
Try to make it all OK

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,640
Does it hurt

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,570
To know ill never be there

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,950
Bet it sucks

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,950
To see my face everywhere

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,520
It was you

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,800
Who chose to end it

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,550
Like you did

25
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,290
I was the last to know

26
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,860
You knew

27
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,860
Exactly what you would do

28
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,230
Don't say

29
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,540
You simply lost your way

30
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,240
She may believe you

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,490
But I never will

32
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,290
Never again

33
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,990
If she really knows

34
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,420
The truth

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,860
She deserves you

36
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,420
A trophy wife

37
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh how cute

38
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,370
Ignorance is bliss

39
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,240
But when your day comes

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,810
And he's through with you

41
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,560
And he'll be through with you

42
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,060
You'll die together but alone

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,930
You wrote me in a letter

44
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,710
You couldn't say it right

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,250
To my face

46
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,590
Give me that

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,520
Sunday school answer

48
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,490
Repent your self away

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,090
Does it hurt

50
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,910
To know ill never be there

51
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,340
Bet it sucks

52
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,160
To see my face everywhere

53
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,850
It was you

54
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,170
Who chose to end it

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,910
Like you did

56
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,690
I was the last to know

57
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,230
You knew

58
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,100
Exactly what you would do

59
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,850
Don't say

60
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,670
You simply lost your way

61
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,530
They may believe you

62
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,730
But I never will

63
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,980
Never again

64
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,350
Never again

65
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,170
Will I hear you

66
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,670
Never again

67
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,410
Will I miss you

68
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,920
Never again

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,520
Will I fall to you

70
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,590
Never

71
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,400
Never again

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,220
Will I kiss you

73
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,590
Never again

74
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,520
Will I want to

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Never again

76
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,210
Will I love you

77
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,330
Never

78
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,350
Does it hurt

79
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,160
To know ill never be there

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,600

81
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,290
To see my face everywhere

82
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,840
It was you

83
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,400
Who chose to end it

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,150
Like you did

85
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,960
I was the last to know

86
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,580
You knew

87
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,340
Exactly what you would do

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,020
Don't say

89
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,830
You simply lost your way

90
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,580
They may believe you

00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,710
I never Will

93
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,780
I never will

94
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,840
Never again
