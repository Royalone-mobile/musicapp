1
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:13,653
I'm trying not to pretend,

2
00:00:13,688 --> 00:00:17,188
It won't happen again and again like that.

3
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:19,655
I never thought it would end,

4
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,048
'cause you got up in my head, in my head like that.

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,476
And made me happy, baby, love is crazy,

6
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:31,178
So amazing, but it's changing, rearranging,

7
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:35,361
I don't think I can take anymore

8
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:38,222
'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down,

9
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:41,808
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never.

10
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:44,136
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around,

11
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:47,511
And it's burning for forever and always.

12
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:50,039
You gotta let it go the other way

13
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:51,599
And live for another day,

14
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,875
'cause it ain't the same, my baby.

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,286
Watch it all falling to the ground.

16
00:00:56,321 --> 00:01:01,560
No happy ever after  just disaster.

17
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,760
I didn't want it this way,

18
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:11,607
I only wanted to say I loved you right.

19
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,672
But now you're walking away,

20
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:14,996
And leaving me here to stay,

21
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:18,477
So foolish of me to wait for you to realize

22
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,366
All the things I gave you, made you,

23
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,644
Changed you, your dreams came true

24
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,711
When I met you, now forget you,

25
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,463
Don't want anymore

26
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:32,449
'Cause the walls burned up and our love fell down

27
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:35,840
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never.

28
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,414
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around,

29
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:41,653
And it's burning for forever and always.

30
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:44,080
You gotta let it go the other way

31
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:45,633
At least for another day,

32
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,875
Cause it ain't the same, my baby.

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,348
Watch it all falling to the ground.

34
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:53,900
No happy ever after  just disaster.

35
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:57,410
You shot the bullet, you shot the bullet that killed me,

36
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:00,142
Not feeling my heart beat, and now it's dying.

37
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:04,365
I am through it, I-I am through the agony,

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,231
Now my eyes are drying, drying,

39
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,722
No more crying,

40
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:11,558
Lying's just a game.

41
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:13,179
So disaster strikes,

42
00:02:13,214 --> 00:02:14,496
And I'm alright

43
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:22,177
'cause my love's on its way... yeah

44
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:29,762
Burning up forever and always... yeah

45
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:32,320
'Cause the walls burned up, and our love fell down,

46
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:35,744
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never.

47
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:38,314
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around,

48
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,347
And it's burning for forever and always.

49
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:44,155
You gotta let it go the other way

50
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,624
At least for another day,

51
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,949
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby.

52
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:50,315
Watch it all falling to the ground.

53
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,094
No happy ever after just disaster.

54
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,274
'Cause the walls burned up, and our love fell down,

55
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,756
And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never.

56
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,399
Feel the fire 'cause it's all around,

57
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:05,595
And it's burning for forever and always.

58
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,162
You gotta let it go the other way

59
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:09,584
At least for another day,

60
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:11,958
'Cause it ain't the same, my baby.

61
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:14,253
Watch it all falling to the ground.

62
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:20,484
No happy ever after  just disaster, just disaster

63
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:31,580
Burning for forever and always, yeah.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
