1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,930
I've never seen you before. You work at the club?

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,550
Leave me alone, I'm with someone

3
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,920
- Really?
- Yeah
- Who?

4
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,330
That guy over there

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,810
Look I've never seen you before. You work at the club?

6
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,740
Baby I'm really bored

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,340
You're bored?

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,910
- Yeah
- Really?
 - Yes

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,920
- So I'm boring you?
- That's right
-For me

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,640
I happen to think I'm a lot of fun

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,240
Ok, well, what are you going to do to entertain me?

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:01:00,370
    

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,030
You like to play? You got a car?

14
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,560
- Let's get out of here
- Let's go

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:24,040
    

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,540
Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man

17
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,420
You know I gave you the world

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,680
You had me in the palm of your hand

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,860
So why your love went away

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,920
I just can't seem to understand

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,290
Thought it was me and you babe

22
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,610
Me and you until the end

23
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,540
But I guess I was wrong

24
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,040
Don't want to think about it

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,670
Don't want to talk about it

26
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,360
I'm just so sick about it

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,980
Can't believe it's ending this way

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,420
Just so confused about it

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,040
Feeling the blues about it

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,670
I just can't do without ya

31
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,480
Tell me is this fair?

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,790
Is this the way it's really going down?

33
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,360
Is this how we say goodbye?

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,110
Should've known better when you came around

35
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,920
That you were gonna make me cry

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,420
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around

37
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,170
'Cause I know that you're living a lie

38
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,360
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,540
What goes around, goes around, goes around

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,230
Comes all the way back around

41
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,420
What goes around, goes around, goes around

42
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,360
Comes all the way back around

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,980
What goes around, goes around, goes around

44
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,860
Comes all the way back around

45
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,980
What goes around, goes around, goes around

46
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,170
Comes all the way back around

47
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,110
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,040
You said that you were moving on now

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,360
And maybe I should do the same

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,730
Funny thing about that is

51
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,790
I was ready to give you my name

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,610
Thought it was me and you, babe

53
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,790
And now, it's all just a shame

54
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,040
And I guess I was wrong

55
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,910
- So this is her
- This is her

56
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,410
This is the one
The one

57
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,480
This is the one

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,110
Hello

59
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,720
Unless she plays her cards right,
she might even get the keys to the castle

60
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,270
I don't want your keys

61
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,000
Shut up!

62
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,910
You make me shut up

63
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,600
Whoa whoa whoa, slow down, partner

64
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,020
You guys have been what? A month


65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,390
And you're telling me you're ready to lock it up
and leave all the pretty girls to me?

66
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,630
Maybe

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,090
I like girls

68
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,580
Me too

69
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,040
A lot

70
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,520
I like everything

71
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,840
of course you do, of course you do!

72
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,620
Let me tell you something

73
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,250
You're awesome and you're awesome and
you're awesome and you're awesome

74
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,320
- And this deservers a toast, ok?
- OK

75
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,240
Come here, come on

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,330
To...

77
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,470
To you, and me.

78
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,040
    

79
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,540
Don't want to think about it

80
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,110
Don't want to talk about it

81
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,790
I'm just so sick about it

82
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,420
Can't believe it's ending this way

83
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,920

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,170
I just can't do without ya

86
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,040
Can you tell me is this fair?

87
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Is this the way things are going down?

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,730
Is this how we say goodbye?

89
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:38,860
Should've known better when you came around
That you were going to make me cry

90
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,730
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around

91

'Cause I know that you're living a lie

Comes all the way back around

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,110
What goes around comes around
Don't want to think about it (no)

102
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,540
Don't want to talk about it

Feeling the blues about it (yeah)

107
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,480
I just can't do without ya

108
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,670

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,060
You're my best friend!

118
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,060
What? What? What?

119
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,810
Nothing happended?

120
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,460
    

121
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,900
Come here, come... ok.

122
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,420
   

123
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,810
With my friend, huh?

124
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,790
You **** crazy, you don't *** know me.

125
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,020
I *** know you!

126
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,600
    

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,690
Leave me alone!

128
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,990
Get back here!

129
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,650
Open the door! Open the door!

130
00:06:50,650 --> 00:07:13,540
    

131
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,790
Let me paint this picture for you, baby

132
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,170
You spend your nights alone

133
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,790
And he never comes home

134
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,040
And every time you call him

135
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,980
All you get's a busy tone

136
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,670
I heard you found out

137
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,290
That he's doing to you

138
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,610
What you did to me

139
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,420
Ain't that the way it goes

140
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,790
You cheated girl

141
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,360
My heart bleeds girl

142
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,230
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt

143
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,920
Just a classic case

144
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,730
A scenario

145
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,290
Tale as old as time

146
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,980
Girl you got what you deserved

147
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,750
And now you want somebody

148
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,040
To cure the lonely nights

149
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,540
You wish you had somebody

150
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,170
That could come and make it right

151
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,730
But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy

152
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,230
You'll see

153
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,610
(What goes around comes back around)

154
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,360
I thought I told ya, hey

155
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,670
(What goes around comes back around)

156
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,360
I thought I told ya, hey

157
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,230
(What goes around comes back around)

158
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,230
I thought I told ya, hey

159
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,420
(What goes around comes back around)

160
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,480
I thought I told ya, hey

161
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,230
See?

162
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:40,610
You should've listened to me, baby

163
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

164
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,040
Because

165
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:59,040
(What goes around comes back around)
