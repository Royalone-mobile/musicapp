1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,120
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,990
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,750
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin

4
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,630
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,460
Do you ever feel already buried deep?

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,600
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,250
Do you know that there's still a chance for you

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,210
'Cause there's a spark in you?

9
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,010
You just gotta ignite the light

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,890
and let it shine

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,730
Just own the night

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,100
like the 4th of July

13
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,020
'Cause baby, you're a firework

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,840
Come on, show 'em what you're worth

15
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,170
Make 'em go, oh

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,970
As you shoot across the sky

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,570
Baby, you're a firework

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,310
Come on, let your colors burst

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,670
Make 'em go, oh

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,890
You're gonna leave 'em falling down

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,550
You don't have to feel like a waste of space

22
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,530
You're original, cannot be replaced

23
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,300
If you only knew what the future holds

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,060
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

25
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,880
Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed

26
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,800
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road

27
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,750
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow

28
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,670
And when it's time, you'll know

29
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,400
You just gotta ignite the light

30
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,220
and let it shine

31
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,210
Just own the night

32
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,550
like the 4th of July

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,440
'Cause baby you're a firework

34
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,260
Come on, show 'em what you're worth

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,720
Make 'em go, oh

36
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,850
As you shoot across the sky

37
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,920
Baby, you're a firework

38
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,670
Come on, let your colors burst

39
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,070
Make 'em go, oh

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,150
You're gonna leave 'em falling down

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,850
Boom, boom, boom

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,730
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,630
It's always been inside of you, you, you

44
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,790
And now it's time to let it through

45
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,980
'Cause baby you're a firework

46
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,760
Come on, show 'em what you're worth

47
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,080
Make 'em go, oh

48
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,810
As you shoot across the sky

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,360
Baby, you're a firework

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,080
Come on, let your colors burst

51
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,520
Make 'em go, oh

52
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,150
You're gonna leave 'em falling down

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,260
Boom, boom, boom

54
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,680
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

55
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,020
Boom, boom, boom

56
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,130
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
