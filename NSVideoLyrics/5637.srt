1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
It's the boy you never told I like you

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,480
It's the girl you let get away

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,410
It's the one you saw that day on the train

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,750
But you freaked out and walked away

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,470
It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,320
Things you swear you'll do before you die

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,050
It's the city of love that waits for you

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,720
But you're too damn scared to fly

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,250
Hit the lights

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,500
Let the music move you

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,540
Lose yourself tonight

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,410
Come alive

13
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,200
Let the moment take you

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,990
Lose control tonight

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,790
Hit the lights

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,210
Let the music move you

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,200
Lose yourself tonight

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,060
Come alive

19
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,600
Let the moment take you

20
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,200
Lose control tonight

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,500
It's the time that you totally screwed up

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,090
Still you're tryin' get it out your brain

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,820
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,540
It's the past that you're dyin' to change

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,030
It's all the money that you're saving

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,690
While the good life passes by

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,540
It's all the dreams that never came true

28
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,320
Coz you're too damn scared to try

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,820
Hit the lights

30
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,370
Let the music move you

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,410
Lose yourself tonight

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,200
Come alive

33
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,680
Let the moment take you

34
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,740
Lose control tonight

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,540
Hit the lights

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,090
Let the music move you

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,000
Lose yourself tonight

38
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,860
Come alive

39
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,410
Let the moment take you

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,580
Lose control tonight

41
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,500
It's a mad mad world

42
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,310
Gotta make an escape

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,170
It's a perfect world

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,840
When you go all the way

45
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,640
Hit the lights

46
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,060
Let the music move you

47
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,100
Lose yourself tonight

48
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,520
So let's go go go go

49
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,700
All the way

50
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,120
Yeah lets go go go

51
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,300
Night and day

52
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,850
From floor to the rafters

53
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,710
People raise your glasses

54
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,420
We could dance forever

55
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,150
Hit the lights

56
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,640
Let the music move you

57
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,750
Lose yourself tonight

58
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,670
Come alive

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,970
Let the moment take you

60
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,200
Lose control tonight

61
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,060
It's a mad mad world

62
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,930
Gotta make an escape

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,730
It's a perfect world

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,410
When you go all the way

65
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,200
Hit the lights

66
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,630
Let the music move you

67
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,540
Lose yourself tonight
