1
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,700

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,300
To have the Kingdom, baby, tell me why

3

My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?

4

To rule the country, baby, you and I?

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,440
If you were my King...

6

To rule the country, baby, you and I?

10
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,450
Little princess in a terrible mess,

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,280
a kingdom alone, with no love to confess

12
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,950
Dreams of a prince on a tall white horse,

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,860
runs like a spirit by the castle walls.

14
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,580
Gotta steal from the rich, when they don't know I'm coming,

15
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,080
gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin'

16
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,160
My oh my don't you cry, 'cause there is no way I'm staying,

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,130
I will leave say �bye bye�, I'm going my way...

18
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,140
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?

19
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,790
To have the Kingdom, baby, tell me why

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,430
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?

To rule the country, baby, you and I?

22
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,780
If you were my King...

23
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,450
I would be your Queen....

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,000
If you were my King...

25
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,790
I would be your Queen....

26
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,970
Mystery deep in the royal heart

27
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,550
Crying at night, I wanna be apart

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,120
Prince, oh, prince are you really sincere?

29
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,780
That you one day are gonna disappear?

30
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,330
Gotta steal from the rich, when they don't know I'm coming,

31
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,910
gotta give to the poor, no time for lovin'

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,000
My oh my don't you cry, 'cause there is no way I'm staying,

33

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,900
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye?
