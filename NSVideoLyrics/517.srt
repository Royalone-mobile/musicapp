1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,930
You're insecure

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,930
Don't know what for

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,050
You're turning heads

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,670
When you walk through the do o or

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,720
Don't need make up to cover up

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,390
Being the way that you are is e eno ough

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,890
Everyone else in the room can see it

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,940
Everyone else but you

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,130
Baby you light up my world

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,750
Like nobody else

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,940
The way that you flip your hair

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,620
Gets me overwhelmed

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,810
But when you smile at the ground

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,550
It ain't hard to tell

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,050
You don't know oh oh

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,670
You don't know you're beautiful

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,920
If only you saw what I can see

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,850
You'll understand

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,970
Why I want you so desperately

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,100
Right now I'm looking at you

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,900

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,090
You don't know you're beautiful

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,830
Oh oh that's what makes you beautiful

25
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,130
So c-come on you got it wrong

26
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,040
To prove I'm right I put it in a so o ong

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,890
I don't know why you're being shy

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,260
And turn away when I look into

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,890
Your eye eye eyes

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,180
Everyone else in the room can see it

31

Everyone else but you

32
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,500
