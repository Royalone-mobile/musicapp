1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
My angel

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,940
How'd you get to be so fly?

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,600
How'd you get to shine so bright, girl?

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,260
How'd you get to look like that?

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,450
Heaven don't you call her back

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,880
Yeah

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,800
Halo, halo

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,380
I'm not sayin' hi

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,090
Baby, there's a ring above your head

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:48,270
And it shines so bright in the sunlight, in the sunlight

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,630
Ayo, ayo

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,130
This is like a dream

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,840
Every bit of you, it makes me wake

14
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,410
How did I get here?

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,990
In the sunlight, in the sun

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,810
I must be in heaven

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,200
Cause I'm looking at an angel

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,650
Who's staring back at me

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,980
Her eyes so heavenly

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,230
I must be in heaven

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,540
Cause I'm looking at an angel

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,040
There's no one on this earth

23
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,130
That's made this beautiful

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,770
I must be in heaven

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,920
Here we are, looking at the stars

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,370
I can hear the beating of your heart

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,380
And I could listen to this song forever

28
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,390
You're the breeze, cruising down the coast

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,260
You're the jelly, baby I'm the toast

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,060
It's so sweet when we're together

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,710
And if I ruled the world

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,770
I'd name an island for ya

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,460
You can tell all your girls

34
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,140
I named an island for you

35
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,570
I must be in heaven

36
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,030
Cause I'm looking at an angel

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,460
Who's staring back at me

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,710
Her eyes so heavenly

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,950
I must be in heaven

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,390
Cause I'm looking at an angel

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,820
There's no one on this earth

42
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,130
That's made this beautiful

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,510
I must be in heaven

44
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,070
Halo, halo

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm not sayin' hi

46
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,620
Baby, there's a ring above your head

47
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,990
And it shines so bright in the moonlight, in the moonlight

48
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,430
My angel

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,180
How'd you get to be so fly?

50
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,500
How'd you get to shine so bright, girl?

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,230
How'd you get to look like that?

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,670
Please heaven don't you call her back

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,660
Oh

54
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,970
My angel

55
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,390
My angel
