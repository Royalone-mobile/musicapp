1
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:15,256
I'll be the one

2
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:32,135
I guess you were lost when I met you

3
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,388
Still there were tears in your eyes

4
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:40,721
So out of trust and I knew

5
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:45,748
No more than mysteries and lies

6
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:50,073
There you were, wild and free

7
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:54,257
Reachin' out like you needed me

8
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:58,738
A helping hand to make it right

9
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:02,436
I am holding you all through the night

10
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:07,298
I'll be the one

11
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,952
Who will make all your sorrows undone

12
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:16,029
I'll be the light

13
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:19,761
When you feel like there's nowhere to run

14
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:22,088
I'll be the one

15
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:28,537
To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright

16
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:30,853
'Cause my faith is gone

17
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:37,346
And I want to take you from darkness to light

18
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:42,393
There you were, wild and free

19
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:46,660
Reachin' out like you needed me

20
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:51,253
A helping hand to make it right

21
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:54,913
I am holding you all through the night

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,502
I'll be the one

23
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:03,211
Who will make all your sorrows undone

24
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:08,081
I'll be the light

25
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:12,210
When you feel like there's nowhere to run

26
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:15,329
I'll be the one

27
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:28,881
You need me like I need you

28
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,885
We can share our dreams comin' true

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,439
I can show you what true love means

30
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:45,168
Just take my hand, baby please

31
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:48,586
I'll be the one

32
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,619
I'll be the light

33
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,780
Where you can run

34
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:54,973
To make it alright

35
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,053
I'll be the one

36
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,409
I'll be the light

37
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:01,576
Where you can run

Where you can run

45
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,028
To make it alright

46
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:32,178
I'll be the one

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,011
To make it all right

50
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:42,161
To hold you

51
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:48,890
