1
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,640
So what am I not supposed to have an opinion

2
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,780
Should I be quiet just because I'm a woman

3
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,750
Call me a bitch cos I speak what's on my mind

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,750
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,700
When a female fires back

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,010
Suddenly the target don't know how to act

7
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,530
So he does what any little boy will do

8
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,170
Making up a few false rumors or two

9
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,480
That for sure is not a man to me

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,780
Slanderin' names for popularity

11
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,070
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy

12
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,030
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,990
This is for my girls all around the world

14
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,530
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth

15
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,800
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,180
So what do we do girls?

17
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,430
Shout louder!

18
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,590
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,070
Lift your hands high and wave them proud

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,380
Take a deep breath and say it loud

21
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,310
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

22
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:35,330
Nobody can hold us down

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,450
Never can, never will

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,210
So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,630
Are you offended by the message I'm bringing

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,650
Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,690
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

28
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,510
If you look back in history

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,040
It's a common double standard of society

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,330
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,940
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore

32
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,320
I don't understand why it's okay

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,720
The guy can get away with it & the girl gets named

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,110
All my ladies come together and make a change

35
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,870
Start a new beginning for us everybody sing

36
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,890
This is for my girls all around the world

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,400
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,740
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard

39
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,080
So what do we do girls?

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
Shout louder!

41
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,530
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground

42
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,970
Lift your hands high and wave them proud

43
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,200
Take a deep breath and say it loud

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,990
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

45
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,250
Check it - Here's something I just can't understand

46
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,450
If the guy have three girls then he's the man

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,900
He can either give us some head, sex her off

48
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,290
If the girl do the same, then she's a whore

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,880
But the table's about to turn

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,910
I'll bet my fame on it

51
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,840
Cats take my ideas and put their name on it

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,460
It's aiight though, you can't hold me down

53
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,900
I got to keep on movin'

54
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,370
To all my girls with a man who be tryin to mack

55
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,830
Do it right back to him and let that be that

56
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,090
You need to let him know that his game is whack

57
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,160
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,590
But you're just a little boy

59
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,920
Think you're so cute, so coy

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,700
You must talk so big

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,630
To make up for small lil' things

62
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,640
So you're just a little boy

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,560
All you'll do is annoy

64
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,310
You must talk so big

65
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,190
To make up for small lil' things

66
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,620
This is for my girls...

67
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,470
This is for my girls all around the world

68
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,950
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth

69
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,300
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard

70
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,650
So what do we do girls?

71
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,760
Shout louder!

72
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,080
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground

73
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,500
Lift your hands high and wave them proud

74
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,730
Take a deep breath and say it loud

75
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,360
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,720
This is for my girls all around the world

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,190
Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth

78
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,510
Thinking all women should be seen, not heard

79
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,880
So what do we do girls?

80
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,010
Shout louder!

81
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,290
Letting them know we're gonna stand our ground

82
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,760
Lift your hands high and wave them proud

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,030
Take a deep breath and say it loud

84
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,710
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

85
00:03:51,710 --> 00:04:07,990
    

86
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,210
Spread the word, can't hold us down
