1
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,550
Love can be a many splendored thing

2
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:27,700
Can't deny the joy it brings

3
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:30,880
A dozen roses, diamond rings

4
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:35,220
Dreams for sale and fairy tales

5
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:38,810
It'll make you hear a symphony

6
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,680
And you just want the world to see

7
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,600
But like a drug that makes you blind,

8
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,800
It'll fool ya every time

9
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,140
The trouble with love is

10
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:57,730
It can tear you up inside

11
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,370
Make your heart believe a lie

12
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,750
It's stronger than your pride

13
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:09,010
The trouble with love is

14
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:13,110
It doesn't care how fast you fall

15
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,950
And you can't refuse the call

16
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,370
See, you got no say at all

17
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:22,210
 

18
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:25,930
Now I was once a fool, it's true

19
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:29,850
I played the game by all the rules

20
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,180
But now my world's a deeper blue

21
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:37,190
I'm sadder, but I'm wiser too

22
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:41,490
I swore I'd never love again

23
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:45,530
I swore my heart would never mend

24
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,870
Said love wasn't worth the pain

25
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,610
But then I hear it call my name

26
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,690
(The trouble with) The trouble with love is

27
00:01:55,699 --> 00:02:00,130
It can tear you up inside

28

Every time I turn around

36
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:31,550
I think I've got it all figured out

37
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:35,370
My heart keeps callin' and I keep on fallin'

38
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,960
Over and over again

39
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:43,840
This sad story always ends the same

40
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:47,770
Me standing in the pouring rain

41
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:50,780
It seems no matter what I do

42
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:53,770
It tears my heart in two

43
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,600
