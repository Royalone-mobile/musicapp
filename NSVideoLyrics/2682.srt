Dance with the wind

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,650
Listen to snowflakes

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,660
Whisper your name

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,110
Feel all the wonder

Touch every rainbow

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,270
Painting the sky

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,360
Look at the magic

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,480
Glide through your life

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:07,470
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night you can fly

So we'll find a home

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,330
