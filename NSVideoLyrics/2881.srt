1
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,414
Standing at this liquor store,

2
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:20,937
Whisky coming through my pores,

3
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:24,050
Feeling like I run this whole block.

4
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:25,757
Lotto tickets and cheap beer

5
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,281
That's why you can catch me here,

6
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:30,373
Tryna scratch my way up to the top.

7
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:33,266
Because my job got me going nowhere,

8
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,408
So I ain't got a thing to lose.

9
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:39,584
Take me to a place where I don't care,

10
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:42,866
This is me and my liquor store blues.

11
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,833
I'll take one shot for my pain,

12
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:49,460
One drag for my sorrow.

13
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:52,384
Get messed up today,

14
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,251
I'll be ok tomorrow.

15
00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:58,757
One shot for my pain,

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,177
One drag for my sorrow.

17
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:05,172
Get messed up today,

18
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:08,870
I'll be ok tomorrow.

19
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,825
Me and my guitar tonight,

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,312
Singing to the city lights,

21
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:16,480
Tryna live on more than what I got.

22
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:19,843
Cause '68 Citrus ain't gonna pay the rent,

23
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:22,729
So I'll be out here til they call the cops.

24
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:25,702
Because my job got me going nowhere,

25
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:28,832
So I ain't got a thing to lose.

26
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:32,037
Take me to a place where I don't care,

27
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:35,321
This is me and my liquor store blues.

28
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:38,181
I'll take one shot for my pain,

29
00:01:38,216 --> 00:01:41,957
One drag for my sorrow.

30
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:44,645
Get messed up today,

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,196
I'll be ok tomorrow.

32
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:51,246
One shot for my pain,

33
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:54,639
One drag for my sorrow.

34
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:57,504
Get messed up today,

35
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:01,148
I'll be ok tomorrow.
