1
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,790
Come here

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,090
Let me take you on a trip

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,190
Leaving in the name of love

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,490
Silence and emptiness

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,290
You're among a billion stars

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,590
Please don't say a single word

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,590
All around the galaxy

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,590
Silence and emptiness

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,390
Let's go into space

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,690
Heading for Venus

11
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,790
Fly around the Sun

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,990
Playmate to Jesus

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,490
Everywhere I go, I pray

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,390
For universal love

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,790
High above the sky

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,190
Closer to Heaven

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,990
Here among the stars

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,690
All is forgiven

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,690
Everywhere I go, I pray

20
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,990
For universal love

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,990
I'm hearing nothing - is it me or is it you?

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,290
I keep on trying but you're just not coming through

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,790
I see your signal but I keep on losing it

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,190
I'll find your frequency bit by bit

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,790
Forgive me

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,390
Please, forgive the things I've done

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,690
Every little matters here

28
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,490
Life keeps moving on

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,290
Everlasting energy

30
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,990
Shining all over me

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,190
Falling into gravity

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,390
Silence and emptiness

33
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,790
Let's go into space

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,990
Heading for Venus

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,190
Fly around the Sun

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,680
Playmate to Jesus

37
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,680
Everywhere I go, I pray

38
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,290
For universal love

39
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,080
High above the sky

40
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,490
Closer to Heaven

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,480
Here among the stars

42
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,080
All is forgiven

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,980
Everywhere I go, I pray

44
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,080
For universal love

45
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,280
(Can you hear me?) I'm hearing nothing - is it me or is it you?

46
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,780
(Can you hear me?) I keep on trying but you're just not coming through

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,080
(Can you hear me?) I see your signal but I keep on losing it

48
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,180
(Can you hear me?) I'll find your frequency bit by bit

49
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,880
Love spreads love - forevermore

50
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,180
Fear spreads fear - the Devil's core

51
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,380
Take my hand and follow me

52
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,180
It's magical

53
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,180
This moment's gonna change my life

54
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,580
(Can you hear me?) Love spreads love - forevermore

55
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,980
(Can you hear me?) Fear spreads fear - the Devil's core

56
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,180
(Can you hear me?) Take my hand and follow me

57
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,980
(Can you hear me?) It's magical - so here we go

58
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,180
Let's go into space

59
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,480
Heading for Venus

60
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,480
Fly around the Sun

61
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,080
Playmate to Jesus

62
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,180
Everywhere I go, I pray

63
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,080
For universal love

64
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,780
High above the sky

65
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,180
Closer to Heaven

66
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,980
Here among the stars

67
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,480
All is forgiven

68
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,480
Everywhere I go, I pray

69
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,080
For universal love

70
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,680
(Can you hear me?) I'm hearing nothing - is it me or is it you?

71
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,280
(Can you hear me?) I keep on trying but you're just not coming through

72
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,580
(Can you hear me?) I see your signal but I keep on losing it

73
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,180
(Can you hear me?) I'll find your frequency bit by bit

74
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,560
Life keeps moving on (Love) (Love)

75
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,560
Life keeps moving on (Love)
