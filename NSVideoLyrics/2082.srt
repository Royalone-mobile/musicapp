1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,390
Ohh Ohh Ohh .. and I pray

2
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,320
I just can't sleep tonight

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
Knowing that things aint right

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,190
Its in the papers, its on the tv, its everywhere that I go

5
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,440
Children are crying

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,060
Soldiers are dying

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,560
Some people don't have a home

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,900
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,900
I know there's good times behind that pain, hey

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,900
Can you tell me how I can make a change

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,080
I close my eyes and I can see a better day

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,940
I close my eyes....and pray

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,370
I close my eyes and I can see a better day

14
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,890
I close my eyes...and pray

15
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,180
I lose my appetite...

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,790
Knowing kids starve tonight

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,900
And when I sit up, cause my dinner is still on my plate

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,900
Ooo I got a vision, to make a difference

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,900
And its starting today

20
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,900
Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,900
I know there's good times behind that pain, hey

22
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,900
Haven`t tell me how I can make a change

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,900
I close my eyes and I can see a better day

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,900

I close my eyes...and pray

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,900
For the broken-hearted

28
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,900
I pray for the life not started

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,900
I pray for all the ones not breathing

30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,900
I pray for all the souls in need

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,470

32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,100

I just can't sleep tonight

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Can someone tell how to make a change?

35
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,100
I close my eyes and I can see a better day

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,100
I close my eyes...and pray

37
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,100
