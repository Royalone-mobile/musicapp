3
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:12,583
I just wanna know - where you are

4
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:17,469
I just wanna know - who you're with

5
00:00:18,198 --> 00:00:23,310
I just wanna know - you can tell me everything now

6
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:29,115
Will you come a bit closer? You just need to take my hand and smile

7
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:32,822
I will tell you from one to ten

8
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:38,788
From the moment you smiled at me, I fell for you

9
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:43,458
Even the smallest and slightest face expressions

10
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:49,342
Without knowing, I keep noticing and I just keep laughing

11
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:53,814
(Baby stay by my side, walk with me by my side)

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,493
Little by little, I hope my heart touches you

13
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:04,289
(Baby stay by my side, walk with me by my side)

14
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:07,223
Just like that, come a bit more to my side

15
00:01:07,422 --> 00:01:09,899
Now I will be by your side

16
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:14,352
I just wanna know - where you are

17
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:19,788
I just wanna know - who you're with

18
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:24,999
I just wanna know - you can tell me everything now

19
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:30,984
Will you come a bit closer? You just need to take my hand and smile

20
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,871
I think I saw you once in my dreams

21
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:40,027
That expression, the body and hand movements, every single one of them

22
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:46,021
(Yes you) Yes it's you, it's you

23
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:51,436
The one one one one person that I was looking for

24
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:56,150
(Baby stay by my side, walk with me by my side)

25
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:01,550
Little by little, I hope my heart touches you

26
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:06,617
(Baby stay by my side, walk with me by my side)

27
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:09,249
Just like that, come a bit more to my side

28
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,071
Now I will be by your side

29
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:17,732
Now I want to stop having days without you

30
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:22,606
I don't need anything more

31
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:31,777
Memories without you have no meaning at all

32
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:36,898
I just wanna know - where you are

33
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:42,153
I just wanna know - who you're with

34
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:47,672
I just wanna know I just wanna know

35
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:53,342
Will you come a bit closer? You just need to take my hand and smile

36
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:57,848
I just wanna know I just wanna know

37
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,130
I just wanna know I just wanna know

38
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:08,501
I just wanna know I just wanna know

39
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:14,567
I just

40
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:17,461
Thanks Everybody
