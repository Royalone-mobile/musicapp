1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,700
Never say never

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:13,080
Bring it on, JB,
bring it on,

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,830
See I never thought
that I could walk through fire.

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,220
I never thought
that I could take the burn.

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,890
I never had the strength
to take it higher,

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,190
Until I reached the point
of no return.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,570
And there's
just no turning back,

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,060
When your heart's
under attack,

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,790
Gonna give everything I have,

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,370
It's my destiny.

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,030
I will never say never!
I will fight

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,350
I will fight till forever!
make it right

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,470
Whenever you
knock me down,

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,980
I will not stay on
the ground.

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,290
Pick it up,
and never say never.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,240
And never say never

17
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,220
Never say never,

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,150
I never see it,

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,420
I never thought that
l could feel this power.

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,870
I never thought that
l could feel this free.

21
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,140
I'm strong enough
to climb the highest tower.

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,330
And I'm fast enough to run
across the sea.

23
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,930
And there's
just no turning back,

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,380
When your heart's
under attack,

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,140
Gonna give
everything I have,

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,900
Cause this is my destiny.

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,590
I will never say never!
I will fight

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,140
I will fight till forever!
make it right

29
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,700
Whenever you
knock me down,

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,400
I will not stay
on the ground.

31
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,200
Pick it up,
and never say never.

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,990
Here we go!

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,200
Guess who?

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,070
JSmith and JB!

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,620
I gotcha lil bro.

36
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,860
I can handle him.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,220
Hold up, aight?

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,260
I can handle him.

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,240
Now he's bigger than me,

40
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,650
Taller than me,
and he's older than me,

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,610
And stronger than me.

42
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,800
And his arms
a little bit longer than me.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,270
But he ain't on
a JB song with me!

44
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,320
I be trying a chill

45
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,770
They be trying to side
with the thrill.

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,300
No pun intended,
was raised by the power of Will.

47
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,970
Like Luke with the force,
when push comes to shove.

48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,310
Like Cobe with the 4th,
ice water with blood.

49
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,130
I gotta be the best,
and yes

50
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,330
We're the flyest,
like David and Goliath,

51
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,510
I conquered the giant.

52
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,730
So now I got the world
in my hand,

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,990
I was born
from two stars

54
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,410
So the moon's
where I land

55
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,790
I will never say never!
I will fight

56
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,650
I will fight till forever!
make it right

57
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,060
Whenever you
knock me down,

58
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,790
I will not stay
on the ground.

59
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,090
Pick it up,
and never say never.

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,920
I will never say never!
I will say never

61
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,480
I will fight till forever!
make it right

62
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,770
Whenever you
knock me down,

63
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,400
I will not stay
on the ground.

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,730
Pick it up,
and never say never,

65
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:30,000
And never say never,
never say it

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,630
And never say never

67
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:39,740
Never say never,
never say it,

68
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:44,080
And never say never
