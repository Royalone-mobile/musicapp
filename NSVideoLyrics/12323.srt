1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,520
It's been a long time coming

2
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,260
since I've seen your face

3
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,230
And I've never went back trying to replace

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,330
Everything that I've had till my feet went numb

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,450
Praying like a fool that's been on a run

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,130
Heart's still beating but it's not working

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,510
It's like a million dollar phone

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,320
that you just can't ring

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,690
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,560
Yeah, my heart is numb

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,550
But with you

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,490
I feel again

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,480
Yeah with you

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,570
I can feel again

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,190
Yeah

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,820
Woo-hoo

17
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,760
Uuh.. Woo-hoo

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,510
Uuh.. Woo-hoo

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,440
Uuh.. Woo-hoo

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,440
(I Feel Again)

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,190
I'm feeling better ever

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,680
since you've known me

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,240
I was a lonely soul

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,710
but that's the old me

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,770
A long time coming since I've seen your face

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,260
I've never went back trying to replace

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,820
Everything that I broke till my feet went numb

28
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,130
Praying like a fool that just shot a gun

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,620
Heart's still beating but it's not working

30
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,810
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing

31
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,360
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing

32
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,420
Oh my heart is numb

33
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,730
But with you

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,780
I feel again

35
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,470
Yeah with you

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,900
I can feel again

37
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,560
But with you

38
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,050
(I'm feeling better ever since you've known me)

39
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,490
I feel again

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,420

I'm feeling better ever since you've known me

I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me

I'm feeling better ever  since you know me

I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me

59
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,610
A little wiser now but you show me

60
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,100
Yeah, I feel again

61

Feel again...
