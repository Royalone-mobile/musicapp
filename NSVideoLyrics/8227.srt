1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You know that I'm a crazy bitch

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
I do what I want, when I feel like it

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,800
All I wanna do is lose control

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Oh, oh

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,200
But you don't really give a shit

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,200
You go with it, go with it, go with it

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
'Cause you're fuckin' crazy rock n roll

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,000
You said hey, what's your name?

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,400
It took one look and now we're not the same

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, you said hey, and since that day

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,400
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,400
Yeah

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,200
And that's why I smile. It's been a while

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,800
Since every day and everything has felt this right

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,600
And now you turn it all around

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,000
And suddenly you're all I need

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,800
The reason why I smile

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Last night I blacked out, I think

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What did you, what did you put in my drink?

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I remember making out and then

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Oh, oh

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,000
I woke up with a new tattoo

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
Your name is on me and my name is on you

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I would do it all over again

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,000
You said hey, what's your name?

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,400
It took one look and now we're not the same

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, you said hey, and since that day

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,600
You stole my heart and you're the one to blame

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Yeah

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,600
And that's why I smile. It's been a while

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Since every day and everything has felt this right

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,600
And now you turn it all around

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,000
And suddenly you're all I need

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,600
The reason why I smile

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,800
The reason why I smile

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You know that I'm a crazy bitch

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,800
I do what I want, when I feel like it

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
All I wanna do is lose control

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,000
You know that I'm a crazy bitch

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
I do what I want, when I feel like it

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,600
All I wanna do is lose control

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,600
And that's why I smile. It's been a while

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Since every day and everything has felt this right

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,400
And now you turn it all around

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,000
And suddenly you're all I need

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,000
The reason why I smile

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
The reason

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,600
The reason why I smile

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The reason why I smile
