1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,920
Whatcha been doin'? Whatcha been doin?

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,710
Whoa, Whoa,

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,210
Haven't seen ya 'round,

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,270
How you been feelin'? How you been feelin'?

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,430
Whoa, whoa,

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,810
Don't you bring me down,

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,670
All that shit about me,

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,600
Being with him,

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,400
Can't believe,

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,330
All the lies that you told,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,140
Just to ease your own soul,

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,980
But I'm bigger than that,

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,400
No, you don't have my back,

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,070
No, No,

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,910
Hey, how long till the music drowns you out?

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,830
Don't put words up in my mouth,

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,910
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,200
Hey, how long till you face what's goin' on,

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,390
Cause you really got it wrong,

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,610
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,410
Well I'm sorry,

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,320
That he called me,

23
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,060
And that I answered the telephone,

24
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,720
Don't be worried,

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,850
I'm not with him,

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,670
And when I go out tonight,

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,690
I'm going home alone,

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,340
Just got back from my tour,

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,160
I'm a mess girl for sure,

30
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,990
All I want is some fun,

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,880
Guess that I'd better run,

32
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,750
Hollywood sucks you in,

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,620
But it won't spit me out,

34
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,540
Hey, how long till the music drowns you out?

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,650
Don't put words up in my mouth,

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,500
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

37
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,900
Hey, how long till you face what's going on?

38
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,100
Cause you really got it wrong,

39
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,020
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

40
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,360
Hey, how long till you look at your own life,

41
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,410
Instead of looking into mine,

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,710
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,740
Hey, how long till you're leaving me alone,

44
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't you got somewhere to go?

45
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,880
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,420
Whoa, whoa, ha

47
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,290
Whoa, whoa, ha

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,830
Please stop telling all your friends,

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,630
I'm getting sick of them,

50
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,930
Always staring at me like I took him from you,

51
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,040
Hey, how long till the music drowns you out?

52
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,230
Don't put words up in my mouth,

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

54
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,490
Hey, how long till you face what's going on?

55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,880
Cause you really got it wrong,

56
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,770
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

57
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,010
Hey, how long till you look at your own life,

58
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,240
Instead of looking into mine,

59
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,150
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,580
Hey, how long till you're leaving me alone,

61
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,690
Don't you got somewhere to go?

62
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,410
I didn't steal your boyfriend,

63
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ha,

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
Whoa, I didn't steal your boyfriend,

65
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,540
Whoa, whoa whoa, ha,

66
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,630
Whoa, I didn't steal your boyfriend
