1
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,610
You've been doing this hell
for how many years?

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,610
2 years

3
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,530
That's was the long
that did you give yourself

4
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,140
Doing this scene,
doing well?

5
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,180
I don't know.

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,740
I never thought
I'd be doing it for two years even

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,380
Just soot for the stars
if it feels right

8
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,140
Then aim for my heart
if you feel like

9
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,810
Take me away
and make it okay

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,880
I swear
I'll behave

11
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,400
You wanted control,
so we waited

12
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,120
I put on a show,
now I make it

13
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,820
You say I'm a kid,
my ego is big

14
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,740
I don't give
a shit

15
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,260
And it
goes like this

16
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,610
Take me by the tongue
and I'll know you

17
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,760
Kiss me 'til you're drunk
and I'll show you

18
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,550
All
the moves like Jagger

19
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,580
I've got
the moves like Jagger

20
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,640
I don't need to try
to control you

21
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,930
Look into my eyes
and I'll own you

22
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,480
With them
moves like Jagger

23
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,980
I've got
the moves like Jagger

24
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,430
Maybe it's hard
when you feel like

25
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,620
You're broken
and scarred

26
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,060
Nothing feels right

27
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,990
But
when you're with me,

28
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,830
I'll
make you believe

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,940
That
I've got the key

30
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,470
So get in the car,
we can ride it

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,190
Wherever you want,
get inside it

32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,920
And you wanna steer,
but I'm shifting gears

33
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,950
I'll take it
from here

34
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,290
And it
goes like this

35
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,720
Take me by the tongue
and I'll know you

36
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,910
Kiss me 'til you're drunk
and I'll show you

37
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,560
All
the moves like Jagger

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,670
I've got
the moves like Jagger

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,770
I don't need to try
to control you

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,000
Look into my eyes
and I'll own you

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,580
With them
moves like Jagger

42
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,640
I've got
the moves like Jagger

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,130
You wanna know
how to make me smile

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,930
Take control,
own me just for the night

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,620
And if I share my secret,
you're gonna have to keep it

46
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,680
Nobody else
can see this

47
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,140
So watch and learn,
I won't show you twice

48
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,030
Head to toe,
baby rub me right

49
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,860
If I share my secret,
you're gonna have to keep it

50
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,320
Nobody else
can see this

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,280
And it
goes like this

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,820
Take me by the tongue
and I'll know you

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,980
Kiss me 'til you're drunk
and I'll show you

54
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,530
All
the moves like Jagger

55
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,630
I've got
the moves like Jagger

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,800
I don't need to try
to control you

57
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,920
Look into my eyes
and I'll own you

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,520
With them
moves like Jagger

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,670
I've got
the moves like Jagger

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,470
I think
we're pretty much set up

61
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,560
For at least
another year
