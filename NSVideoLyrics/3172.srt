00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:16,870
Mars: "Mars Lander here". "Gravity device status defective, oxygen status 98%".

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,420
Earth: "Any sign of habitation"?

Mars: "Oh, it's cute alright, it couldn't be"?

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,010
Earth: "Mars Lander, what's happening up there"?

I think I did it again

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I made you believe we're more than just friends

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh baby

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It might seem like a crush

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
'Cause to lose all my senses

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That is just so typically me

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh baby, baby

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oops!...I did it again

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I played with your heart, got lost in the game

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh baby, baby

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000

That I'm sent from above

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not that innocent

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You see my problem is this

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm dreaming away

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I cry, watching the days

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But to lose all my senses

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That is just so typically me

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000

"Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have"

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
"Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this...?"

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
"Yeah, yes it is"

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end"

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
"Well baby, I went down and got it for you"

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
"Oh, you shouldn't have"
