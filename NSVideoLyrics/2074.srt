1
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,630
For you I'd write a symphony,

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,380
I'd tell the violin,

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,120
It's time to sink or swim,

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,620
Watch them play for ya,

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,060
For you I'd be, (whoa oh)

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,740
Running a thousand miles,

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,110
Just to get to where you are.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,730
Step to the beat of my heart,

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,540
I don't need a whole lot,

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,290
But for you I admit I,

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,980
I'd rather give you the world,

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,350
Or we can share mine,

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,970
I know I won't be the first one,

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,650
giving you all this attention,

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,900
Baby listen,

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,140
I just need somebody to love,

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,760
I don't need too much, just somebody to love,

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,820
Somebody to love.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,380
I don't need nothing else,

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,880
I promise girl I swear,

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,940
I just need somebody to love.

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,560

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,490
I need somebody, I need somebody

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,300
Every day,

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,170
I bring the sun around,

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,790
I sweep away the clouds,

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,600
Smile for me.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,350
I would take,

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,220
Every second, every single time,

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,910
Spend it like my last dime.

31
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,290
Step to the beat of my heart,

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,220
I don't need a whole lot,

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,100
But for you I admit I,

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,040
I'd rather give you the world,

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,100
Or you can share mine,

36
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,650
I know I won't be the first one,

37
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,400
Givin' you all this attention,

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,770
so baby listen,

39
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,270

40
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,070
I don't need too much, just somebody to love,

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,440
Somebody to love.

42
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,070
I don't need nothing else,

43
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,560
I promise girl I swear,

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,680
I just need somebody to love.

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,990

And you can have it all,

00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,030
Anything you want,

53
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,900
I can bring; give you the finer things, yeah

54
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,580
But what I really want,

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,080
I can't find cause,

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,700
Money can't find me,

57
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,250
Somebody to love (oh, oh)
