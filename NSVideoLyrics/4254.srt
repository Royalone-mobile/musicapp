1
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,390
Can you try smiling just once?

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,940
It's embarrassing.

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,870
You look like you're at a funeral

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,140
Why don't we see that pretty little face of yours?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,030
Oy, when I'm talking to you,

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,980
Look me in the face and don't disrespect me.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,850
Sorry about that guys

8
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,410
So you're not working the street corner tonight I see,

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,920
I'm so sorry, what's wrong with you?

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,420
How dare you disrespect like that?

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,490
Who do you think you are?

12
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,010
Who do you think you're talking to?

13
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,520
You're ok?

14
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,440
Yeah,

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,020
Wait!

16
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,150
Now I'm ok!

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,350
He is a hustler, he's no good at all

18
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,910
He is a loser, he's a bum-bum-bum-bum

19
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,420
He lies, he fluffs,

20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,280
He's unreliable

21
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,720
He's is a sucker with a gun

22
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,200
I know you told me I should stay away

23
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,660
I know you said he's just a dog astray

24
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,380
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,940
And even I know this ain't smart

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,880
But, mama, I'm in love with a criminal

27
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,080
And this type of love isn't rational,

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,350
It's physical

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,840
Mamma, please don't cry, I will be all right

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,960
All reason aside, I just can't deny

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,260
I love that guy

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,610
He is a villain by the devil's law

33
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,110
He is a killer just for fun

34
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,570
That man's a snitch, unpredictable

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,920
He's got no conscience, he got none

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,140
I know

37
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,320
Should've let go, but no

38
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,710
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart

39
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,240
And even I know this ain't smart

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,190
But, mama, I'm in love with a criminal

41
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,190
And this type of love isn't rational,

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,470
It's physical

43
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,170
Mamma, please don't cry, I will be all right

44
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,130
All reason aside, I just can't deny

45
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,480
I love that guy

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,790
And he's got my name

47
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,490
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm

48
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,520
So I guess it's okay

49
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,120
He's with me

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,270
And we hear people talk

51
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,130
Trying to make remarks, keep us apart

52
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,320
But I don't even hear

53
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,640
I don't care

54
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,340
Cause, mama, I'm in love with a criminal

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,510
And this type of love isn't rational,

56
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,660
It's physical

57
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,460
Mamma, please don't cry, I will be all right

58
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,370
All reason aside, I just can't deny

59
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,750
I love that guy

60
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,040
Mama, I'm in love with a criminal

61
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,350
And this type of love isn't rational,

62
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,540
It's physical

63
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,930
Mamma, please don't cry, I will be all right

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,130
All reason aside, I just can't deny

65
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,490
I love that guy

66
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,620
The suspects have left the building

67
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,160
I repeat: they have left the building
