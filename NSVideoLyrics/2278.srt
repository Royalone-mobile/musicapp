1
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,850
I wonder how I ever made it through a day

2
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,250
How did I settle for a world in shades of gray

3
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,850
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,850
And you don't know why

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,450
Then I looked into your eyes

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,750
Where the road stretched out in front of me,

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,950
And I realize

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,350
I never lived before your love

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:59,550
I never felt before your touch

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,050
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive

11
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,750
But then again I wasn't really living

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:24,950
I never lived before your love

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,550
I wanted more than just an ordinary life

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,350
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,450
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands

16
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,650
And I don't know how

17
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,050
I survived without your kiss

18
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,650
Cause you're giving me a reason to exist

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,250
I never lived before your love

20
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:11,150
I never felt before your touch

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,650
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive

22
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,750
But then again I wasn't really living

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:34,650
I never lived before your love

24
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:48,550
I never lived before your love

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,550
And I don't know why

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,050
Why the sun decides to shine

27
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,650
But you breathed your love into me just in time

28
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,250
I never lived before your love

29
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,050
I never felt before your touch

30
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:22,650
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive

31
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,750
But then again I wasn't really living

32
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,050
I never lived

33
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:56,250
I never lived before your love
