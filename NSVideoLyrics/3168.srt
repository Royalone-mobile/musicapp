1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,500
This kicked in got your
tongue tied in knots, I see

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,580
Spit it out
'cause I'm dying for company

3
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,260
I notice that
you got it

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,040
You notice
that I want it

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,730
You know that I can take it
to the next level baby

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,460
If you want this good shit
sicker than the remix

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,210
Baby, let me blow
your mind tonight

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,110
I can't take it
no more

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,610
Never felt like
this before

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,630
Come on get me,
get me on the floor

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,080
DJ what you,
what you waiting for?

12
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,020
Watch me move
when I lose,

13
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,270
When I lose it hard

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,330
Get you off with the
touching dance in the dark

15
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,060
You notice
what I'm wearing

16
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,810
You notice
when you're stepping

17
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,420
You know that I can take it
to the next level baby

18
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,290
Hotter than
the A-list

19
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,090
Next one on
my hit list

20
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,870
Baby let me blow
your mind tonight

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,780
I can't take it
no more

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,370
Never felt like
this before

23
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,350
Come on get me,
get me on the floor

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,800
DJ what you,
what you waiting for?

25
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,370
See the sunlight,
we ain't stopping

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,160
Keep on dancing
til the world ends

27
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,620
If you feel it,
let it happen

28
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,400
Keep on dancing
til the world ends

29
00:02:49,690 --> 00:03:04,850
Keep on dancing
til the world ends

30
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,020
See the sunlight,
we ain't stopping

31
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,770
Keep on dancing
til the world ends

32
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,370
If you feel it,
let it happen

33
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,100
Keep on dancing
til the world ends
