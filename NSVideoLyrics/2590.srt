1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,870
Let me hear
you say hey hey hey

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,950
Alright, now let me hear
you say hey hey ho

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,190
I hate it when a guy
doesn't get the door

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,240
Even though I told him yesterday
and the day before

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,020
I hate it when a guy
doesn't get the tab

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,360
And I have to pull my money out
and that looks bad

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,500
Where are the hopes,
where are the dreams

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,330
My Cinderella story scene

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,060
When do you think
they'll finally see

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,640
That you're not, not, not
gonna get any better

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,530
You won't, won't, won't
you won't get rid of me never

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,160
Like it or not even though
she's a lot like me

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,020
We're not the same

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,150
And yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a lot to handle

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,120
You don't know trouble
but I'm a hell of a scandal

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,860
Me I'm a scene
I'm a drama queen

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,550
I'm the best damn thing
that your eyes have ever seen

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,440
Alright, alright,
Yeah

19
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,510
I hate it when a guy
doesn't understand

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,460
Why a certain time of month
I don't want to hold his hand

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,600
I hate it when they go out
and we stay in

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,760
And they come home smelling
like their ex-girlfriend

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,970
But I found my hopes
I found my dreams

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,740
My Cinderella story scene

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,230
Now everybody's gonna see

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,870
That you're not, not, not
gonna get any better

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,850
You won't, won't, won't
you won't get rid of me never

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,510
Like it or not even though
she's a lot like me

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,390
We're not the same

30
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,430
And yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a lot to handle

31
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,520
You don't know trouble

that your eyes have ever seen

34
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,050
Give me an A,

35
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,230
Give me a V,
be very, very good to me

36
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,170
R, are you gonna
treat me right

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,680
I, I can put up a fight

38
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,710
Give me an L,
let me hear you scream loud

39
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,610
Let me hear you scream loud

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,300
One, two,
three, four

41
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,320
Where are the hopes,
where are the dreams
