1
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,030
Why is the sky so much more blue?

2
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,270
Why is the breeze so perfect today?

3
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,000
Pretending like I don't know

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Like I didn't hear a thing

5
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,400
Like I erased it

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Should we start talking about something else?

7
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,360
Should we kiss so we can't say anything?

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,030
My eyes fill with tears, so I lift my head up

9
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,030
I smile a little so that they won't fall

10
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,570
Why are you like this to me?

11
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,470
What are you saying?

12
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,430
All the things we talked about go to the sky

13
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,230
The words I have never said

14
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,140
The words I didn't know, I'd say as I cried

15
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,140
I like you, oppa

16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
what do I do?

17
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,380
Was my recently hairstyle change bad?

18
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,380
Did I wear the wrong clothes?

19
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,660
Still pretending like I don't know

20
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,640
Like I don't remember

21
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Should I act as if nothing happened?

22
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,310
Should I just say that we should go out?

23
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,310
My eyes fill with tears, so I lift my head up

24
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,800
I smile a little, so they won't fall

25
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,540
Why are you like this to me?

26
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,370
What are you saying?

27
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,180
All the things we talked about go to the sky

28
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,130
The words I have never said

29
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,030
The words I didn't know, I'd say as I cried

30
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,030
I, oppa, like you

31
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,000
what do I do?

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't say those kind of sad things while looking at me like this

33
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Is it that I'm childish, or a bit slow?

34
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,600
I can't believe it

35
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,540
Even though I'm crying, I smile

36
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,240
I block your way and I just smile widely

37
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,010
Why are I being like this?

38
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,010
Do I have no shame?

39
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,830
I fold up my pride and throw it up to the sky

40
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,300
The words I have never said

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,300
The words I might never be able to say again

42
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,410
I, oppa, like you

43
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,070
(one, two)

44
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,740
I'm in my dream

45
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,070
(It's too beautiful, beautiful day)
I'm in my dream

46
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,210
(It's too beautiful, beautiful day)

47
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,210
(Make it a good day)

48
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,220
(Just don't make me cry)

49
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,000
Such a good day
