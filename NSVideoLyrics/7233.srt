1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,550
I've tried playing it cool

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,270
Girl when I'm looking at you

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,860
I can never be brave

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,790
Cause you make my heart race

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,580
Shot me out of the sky

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,290
You're my kryptonite

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,720
You keep me making me weak

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,720
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,990
Some things gotta get loud

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,770
Cause if not, they just don't make you see

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,800
That I need you here with me now

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,470
Cause you've got that one thing

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,580
So get out, get out, get out of my head

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,490
And fall into my arms instead

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,080
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,870
But I need that one thing

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,970
And you've got that one thing

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,770
Now I'm climbing the walls

19
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,560
But you don't notice at all

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,400
That I'm going out of my mind

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,060
All day and all night

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,350
Some things gotta get loud

23
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,070
Cause I'm dying just to know your name

24
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,070
And I need you here with me now

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,780
Cause you've got that one thing

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,820
So get out, get out, get out of my head

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,610
And fall into my arms instead

28
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,260
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

29
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,710
But I need that one thing

30
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,870
So get out, get out, get out of my mind

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,580
And come on, come into my life

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,320
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,100
But I need that one thing

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,580
And you've got that one thing

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,050
You've got that one thing

36
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,730
Get out, get out, get out of my head

37
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,190
And fall into my arms instead

38
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,240
So get out, get out, get out of my head

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,030
And fall into my arms instead

40
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,750
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

41
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,690
But I need that one thing

42
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,600
Get out, get out, get out of my mind

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,260
And come on, come into my life

44
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,050
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is

45
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,760
But I need that one thing

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,760
And you've got that one thing
