1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,100
This one's for you and me,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,950
Living out our dreams

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,930
We are right where we should be

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,720
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,600
And now all I wanna see

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,880
Is a sky full of lighters

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,820
A sky full of lighters

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,570
By the time you hear this

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,230
I will have already spiralled up

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,380
I would never do nothing

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,970
To let you cowards fuck my world up

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,190
If I was you, I would duck,

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,350
Or get struck like lightening fighters keep fighting,

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,230
Put your lighters up, point em' skyward

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,580
Had a dream I was king,

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,890
I woke up, still king?

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,140
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,250
Till nobody else even fucking feels me,

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,170
Till' it kills me

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:53,840
I swear to god

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,810
I'll be the fucking illest in this music

22
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,200
There is or there ever will be, disagree

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,810
Feel free,

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,090
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up

25
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,770
The only thing I ever gave's using no more excuses

26
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,400
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,140
And pardon me

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,350
If I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,250
Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around,

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,020
Crock-o-shit

31
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,090
Who you dicks try to kid,

32
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,540
Flipped dick, you did the opposite

33
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,210
You stayed the same,

34
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,470
Just cock back with this still cock you pricks

35
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,940
I love it when I tell em shove it

36
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,850
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall said bust a leg

37
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,260
Muster cause he couldn't cut mustard mustered up

38
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,030
Nothing brain fuzzy, cause he's buzzin',

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,830
Woke up from that buzz

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,320
Now you wonder why he does it?

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,890
How he does it?

42
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,240
Wasn't cause he had buzzards circle around his head

43
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,080
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,880
Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off

45
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,490
Little hussy ass, cause fuck it,

46
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,300
Guess it doesn't matter now, does it

47
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,160
What difference it make?

48
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,330
What it take to get it through your thick skulls

49
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,260
As if this ain't some bullshit

50
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,760
People don't usually come back this way

51
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,480
From a place that was dark as I was in

52
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,440
Just to get to this place

53
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,260
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage

54
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,530
And let it be known from this day forward

55
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,860
I wanna just say thanks

56
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,470
Cause your hate is what gave me strength

57
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,430
So let em cause

58
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,770
I came with 5'9' but I feel like I'm 6'8'

59
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,400
This one's for you and me,

60
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,350
Living out our dreams

61
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,280
We are right where we should be

62
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,070
Lift my arms out wide I open my eyes

63
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,930
And now all I wanna see

64
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,350
Is a sky full of lighters

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,280
A sky full of lighters

66
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,560
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,150
I advance like going from toting iron to going

68
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,010
From buying 4 or 5 of the homies to iron man outtie

69
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,830
My daddy told me slow down, boy,

70
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,730
You goin to blow it

71
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,580
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute

72
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,930
To tell Shady I love him

73
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,530
The same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic

74
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,150
Tell him how real he is or high I am

75
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,390
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it

76
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,300
I cried many tears, my daddy got a bad back

77
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,590
So it's only right that I right till he can march

78
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,560
Right into that post office and tell em to hang it up

79
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,200
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,950
I'll stop when I'm at the very top

81
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,800
You shitted on me on your way up

82
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,300
It's bout to be a scary drop

83
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,410
Cause what goes up must come down

84
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,710
You going down on something

85
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,670
You don't wanna see like a hairy box

86
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,260
Every hour, happy hour now

87
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,260
Life is wacky now

88
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,160
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy

89
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,530
Now I'm just the cats meow,

90
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,600
Classic cow,

91
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,190
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao

92
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,970
Ya'll are doomed

93
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,140
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me

94
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,230
My car starts itself,

95
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,660
Parks itself and autotunes

96
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,110
Cause now I'm in the Aston

97
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,130
I went from having my city locked up

98
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,180
To getting treated quite like Patrick

99
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,810
And now I'm fantastic compared to a weed high

100
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,270
And y'all niggas just gossiping

101
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,360
Like bitches on a radio and TV

102
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,910
See me, we fly

103
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,800
Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive

104
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,080
And how real is that

105
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,980
I remember signing my first deal

106
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,070
And now I'm the second best I can deal with that

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,400
Now Bruno can show his ass,

108
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,350
Without the MTV awards gag

109
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,810
You and I know what it's like

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,400
To be kept down, forced to fight

111
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,300
But tonight we're alright

112
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,950
So hold up your light

113
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,400
Let it shine

114
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,370
Cause this one's for you and me

115
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,340
Living out our dreams

116
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,280
We are right where we should be

117
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,130
With my arms out wide I open my eyes

118
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,890
And now all I wanna see

119
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,300
Is a sky full of lighters

120
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,700
A sky full of lighters
