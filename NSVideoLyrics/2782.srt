00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,120
Creation shows me what to do

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm dancing on the floor with you And when you touch my hand

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,820
I go crazy, yeah

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
The music tells me what to feel

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,740
I like you now

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,910
But is it real by the time we say goodnight

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,560
I don't know if this is right

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,180
And I feel you (you) coming through my veins.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:58,080
Am I into you (you) or is it music to blaime?

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,360
Who owns my heart

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,180
Is it love or is it art

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,430
'Cause the way you got your body movin' got me confusin'

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,580
And I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,630
Who owns my heart

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,300
Is it love or is it art

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,640
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,450
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,420
Who owns my heart

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,510
The room is full

25
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,410
But all I see is the way

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,670
Your eyes just blaze through me

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,710
Like fire in the dark

28
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,500
We're like living art

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,940
And it hits me

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,320
Like a ... of wave

31
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,970
Are you feeling me

32
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,720
Or is the music to blame

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,830
Who owns my heart

34
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,220
Is it love or is it art

35
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,680
'Cause the way you got your body movin' got me confusin'

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,250
