1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,460
I will not make the same mistakes that you did

2
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,730
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery

3
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,990
I will not break the way you did

4
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,160
You fell so hard...

5
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,790
I've learned the hard way

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,930
To never let it get that far

7
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,040
Because of you

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,830
I never stray too far from the sidewalk

9
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,710
Because of you

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,540
I learned to play on the safe side So I don't get hurt

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,570
Because of you

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,020
I find it hard to trust Not only me

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,190
But everyone around me

14
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,000
Because of you

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,840
I am afraid

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,800
I lose my way

17
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,290
And it's not too long before you point it out

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,600
I cannot cry

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,190
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,440
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,150
Every day of my life

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,470
My heart can't possibly break

23
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,750
When it wasn't even whole to start with

24
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,630
Because of you

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,390
I never stray too far from the sidewalk

26
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,350
Because of you

27
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,130
I learned to play on the safe side So I don't get hurt

28
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,170
Because of you

29
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,650
I find it hard to trust Not only me

30
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,750
But everyone around me

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,360
Because of you

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,860
I am afraid

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,860
I watched you die, I heard you cry

34
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,560
Every night in your sleep

35
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,880
I was so young

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,680
You should have known better than to lean on me

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,240
You never thought of anyone else You just saw your pain

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,650
And now I cry In the middle of the night

39
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,640
For the same damn thing

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,900
Because of you

41
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,460
I never stray too far from the sidewalk

42
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,860
Because of you

43
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,920
I learned to play on the safe side So I don't get hurt

44
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,630
Because of you

45
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,510
I tried my hardest just to forget everything

46
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,430
Because of you

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,390
I don't know how to let anyone else in

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,370
Because of you

49
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,010
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty

50
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,710
Because of you

51
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,380
I am afraid

52
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,110
Because of you

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,310
Because of you
