1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,150
Oh, her eyes, her eyes

2
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,720
Make the stars look like they're not shining

3
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,600
Her hair,

4
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,130
Falls perfectly without her trying

5
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,590
She's so beautiful

6
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,850
And I tell her every day

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,660
Yeah, I know, I know

8
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,370
When I compliment her she won't believe me

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,110
And its so, it's so

10
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,800
Sad to think she don't see what I see

11
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,270
But every time she asks me do I look okay

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,620
I say

13
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,430
When I see your face

14
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,780
There's not a thing that I would change

15
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,960
Cause you're amazing just the way you are

16
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,860
And when you smile,

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,260
The whole world stops and stares for awhile

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,570
Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,700
Her lips, her lips

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,290
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,050
Her laugh, her laugh

22
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,740
She hates but I think its so sexy

23
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,040
She's so beautiful

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,220
And I tell her every day

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,900
Oh, you know, you know,

26
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,460
I'd never ask you to change

27
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,760
If perfect is what you're searching for

28
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,650
Then just stay the same

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,880
So don't even bother asking if you look okay

30
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,040
You know I'll say

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,920
When I see your face

32
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,450
There's not a thing that I would change

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,550
Cause you're amazing just the way you are

34
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,340
And when you smile,

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,830
The whole world stops and stares for awhile

36
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,170
Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are

37
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,770
The way you are,

38
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,020
The way you are,

39
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:08,490
Girl you're amazing just the way you are

40
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,430
When I see your face

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,350
There's not a thing that I would change

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,350
Cause you're amazing just the way you are

43
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,200
And when you smile,

44
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,070
The whole world stops and stares for awhile

45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:44,080
Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are
