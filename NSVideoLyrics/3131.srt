1
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,960
Say you're sorry,that face of an ange comes out

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,100
Just when youneed it to

3
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,000
As I paced backand forth all this time

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,580
Cause I honestlybelieved in you

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,420
Holding on the days drag onStupid girl,

6
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,900
I should've knownI should've known

7
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,050
I'm not a princess,this ain't a fairytale

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,860
I'm not the oneyou'll sweep off her feet

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,260
Lead her up the stairwell

10
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,480
This ain't hollywood,this is a small town

11
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,100
I was a dreamer before you wentand let me down

12
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,380
Now it's too late for youand your white horse

13
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,540
To come around

14
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,110
Maybe I was naive,got lost in your eyes

15
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,820
And never reallyhad a chance

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,490
My mistake,I didn't know to be in love

17
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,140
You had to fightto have the upper hand

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,710
I had so many dreamsabout you and me

19
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,060
Happy endings,well now I know

20
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,540
I'm not a princess,this ain't a fairytale

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,320
I'm not the oneyou'll sweep off her feet

22
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,710
Lead her up the stairwell

23
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,810
This ain't hollywood,this is a small town

24
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,120
I was a dreamer before you wentand let me down

25
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,320
Now it's too late for youand your white horse

26
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,330
To come around

27
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,090
And there you areon your knees

28
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,400
Begging for forgiveness,begging for me

29
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,240
Just like I always wanted,but I'm so sorry

30
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,630
Cause I'm not your princess,this ain't a fairytale

31
