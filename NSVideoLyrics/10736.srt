1
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,920
There's a place that i know

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,970
It's not pretty there and few have ever gone

3
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,650
If i show it to you now

4
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,580
Will it make you run away

5
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,700
Or will you stay

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,630
Even if it hurts

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,310
Even if i try to push you out

8
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,430
Will you return?

9
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,420
And remind me who i really am

10
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,920
Please remind me who i really am

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,160
Everybody's got a dark side

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,970
Do you love me?

13
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,650
Can you love mine?

14
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,960
Nobody's a picture perfect

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,200
But we're worth it

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,950
You know that we're worth it

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,700
Will you love me?

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,500
Even with my dark side?

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,250
Like a diamond

20
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,930
From black dust

21
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,860
It's hard to know

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,670
It can become

23
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,670
A few give up

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,470
So don't give up on me

25
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,090
Please remind me who i really am

26
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,270
Everybody's got a dark side

27
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,390
Do you love me?

28
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,830
Can you love mine?

29
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,190
Nobody's a picture perfect

30
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,320
But we're worth it

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,450

33
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,550
Even with my dark side?

34
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,920
Don't run away

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,160
Just tell me that you will stay

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,900
Promise me you will stay

37

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:56,740
Will you love me? oh

41
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,980
Everybody's got a dark side

42
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,860
Do you love me?

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,850
Can you love mine?

44
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,660
Nobody's a picture perfect

45
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,530
But we're worth it

46
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,090

Will you love me?

48
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,580
Even with my dark side?

49
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:28,580
Don't run away, don't run away

50
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:38,580
Don't run away, promise you will stay...
