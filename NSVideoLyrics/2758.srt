1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,650
You think I'm pretty

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,130
Without any make-up on

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,660
You think I'm funny

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,270
When I tell the puch line wrong

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,710
I know you get me

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,380
So I'll let my walls come down

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,250
Down

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,800
Before you met me

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,190
I was a wreck but things

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,960
Were kinda heavy

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,400
You brought me to life Now

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,920
Every February

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,780
You'll be my valentine

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,120
valentine

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Let's go all

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,290
The way tonight

17
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,550
No regrets

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,820
Just love

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,940
We can dance

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,110
Until we die

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,670
You and I

22
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,900
We'll be young forever

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,270
You make me

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,060
Feel like I'm living a

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,220
Teenage Dream

26
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,900
The way you turn me on

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,290
I can't sleep

28
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,540
Let's runaway

29
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,600
And don't ever look back

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,590
Don't ever look back

31
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,130
My heart stops

32
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,050
When you look at me

33
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,320
Just one touch

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,990
Now baby I believe

35
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,250
This is real

36
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,520
So take a chance

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,500
And don't ever look back

38
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,590
Don't ever look back

39
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,840
We drove to Cali

40
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,360
And got drunk on the beach

41
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,820
Got a motel and

42
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,160
Built a fort out of sheets

43
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,880
I finally found you

44
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,250
My missing puzzle piece

45
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,700
I'm complete

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,060
Let's go all

47
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,190
The way tonight

48
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,650
No regrets

49
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,830
Just love

50
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,220
We can dance

51
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,200
Until we die

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,720
You and I

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,930
We'll be young forever

54
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,290
You make me

55
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,040
Feel like I'm living a

56
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,180
Teenage Dream

57
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,960
The way you turn me on

58
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,240
I can't sleep

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,590
Let's runaway

60
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,410
And don't ever look back

61
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,470
Don't ever look back

62
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,170
My heart stops

63
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,050
When you look at me

64
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,360

And don't ever look back

69
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,350
Don't ever look back

70
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,630
I might get your heart racing
Don't ever look back

71
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,780
I might get your heart racing

72
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,720
In my skin-tight jeans

73
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,770
Be your teenage dream tonight

74
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,670
Let you put your hands on me

75
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,690
In my skin-tight jeans

76

You

79
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,480
You make me

80
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,240
