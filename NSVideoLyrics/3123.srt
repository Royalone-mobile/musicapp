1
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,770
You were in college working part time waiting tables

2
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,550
Left the small town never looked back

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,540
I was the flight risk with the fear of fallin

4
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,820
Wondered why we bothered with love

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,930
If it never lasts

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,230
I say "Can you believe it?"

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,750
As we're lying on a couch

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,300
The moment I could see it

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,490
Yes, I can see it now

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,330
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water

11
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,450
You put your arm around me for the first time

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,280
You made a rebel out of a careless man's careful daughter

13
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,240
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,630
Flash forward and we'd been taking

15
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,300
On the world together

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,230
And there is a drawer of my things at your place

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,160
You learned my secrets and you figured out

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,110
Why I'm guarded

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,080
You said we'd never make my parents' mistakes

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,020
But we've got bills to pay

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,050
We've got nothing figured out

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,930
When it was hard to take

23
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,070
Yes,

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,560
This is was I thought about Yes,

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,060
This is was I thought about

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,010
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water

27
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,050
You put your arm around me for the first time

28
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,900
You made a rebel out of a careless man's careful daughter

29
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,070
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,850
Do you remember all the city lights on the water

31
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,830
You saw me start to believe for the first time

32
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,790
You made a rebel out of a careless man's careful daughter

33
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,690
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,080
And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,310
Cause everything was slipping right out of my hands

36
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,780
And I ran out crying and you followed me out

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,540
Into the street

38
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,060
Raised myself for the goodbye

39
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,320
Cause that's all I've ever known

40
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,150
And you took me by surprised

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,790
You said "I'll never leave you"

42
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,220
Oh, no

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,600
You said

44
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,380
"I remember how we felt sitting by the water

45
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,410
And every time I look at you is like the first time

46
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,230
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter

47
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,380
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"

48
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,830
Hold on, make it last

49
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,760
Hold on, never turn back

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,080
You made a rebel out of a careless man's careful daughter

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,330
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

52
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,610
Do you believe it?

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,250
We're gonna make it now

54
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,740
And I can see it, yeah

55
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,480
And I can see it now,
