1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,370
What goes around comes back around, hey, my baby,

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,900
What goes around comes back around, my, my, my baby (hey),

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,500
I say, what goes around comes back around, hey, my baby,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,030
What goes around comes back around,

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,530
There was

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,970
A time

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,980
I thought

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,000
That you did everything right,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,530
No lies, no wrong,

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,620
Boy, I must've been out of my mind,

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,370
So when I think of the time that I

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,850
Almost loved you,

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,120
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you,

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,670
Thank God you blew it,

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,340
I thank God I dodged a bullet,

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,020
I'm so over you,

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,070
So, baby, good lookin' out,

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,680
I wanted you bad,

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,870
I'm so through with that,

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,790
'Cause, honestly, you turned out to be the

21
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,330
Best thing I never had,

22
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,820
You turned out to be the

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,450
Best thing I never had,

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,440
And I'm gon' always be the

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,730
Best thing you never had,

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,080
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now,

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,050
So sad, you're hurt,

28
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,950
Boohoo, oh, did you expect me to care?

29
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:43,910
You don't deserve my tears,

30
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,580
I guess that's why they ain't there,

31
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,890
When I think that there was a time that I

32
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,440
Almost loved you,

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,930
You showed your ass and baby, yes,

34
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,290
I saw the real you,

35
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,210
Thank God you blew it,

36
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,700
I thank God I dodged a bullet,

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm so over you,

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,110
Baby, good lookin' out,

39
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,840
I wanted you bad,

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,210
I'm so through with that,

41
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,190
'Cause, honestly, you turned out to be the

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,680
Best thing I never had,

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,230
I said you turned out to be the

44
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,030
Best thing I never had,

45
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,830
Mmm, and I'll never be the

46
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,500
Best thing you never had,

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,770
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now,

48
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,740
I know you want me back,

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,780
It's time to face the facts,

50
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,890
That I'm the one that's got away,

51
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,450
Lord knows that it would take

52
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,500
Another place, another time,

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,050
Another world, another life,

54
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,900
Thank God I found the good in goodbye,

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,450
I used to want you so bad,

56
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,570
I'm so through with that,

57
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,410
'Cause, honestly, you turned out to be the

58
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,160
Best thing I never had,

59
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,940
Oh, you turned out to be the

60
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,360
Best thing I never had,

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,030
And I will always be the

62
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,210
Best thing you never had,

63
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,310
Ooh, best thing you never had,

Oh, you turned out to be the

69
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,390
Best thing I never had,

70

Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now,

73
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,240
Goes around, comes back around (oh),
