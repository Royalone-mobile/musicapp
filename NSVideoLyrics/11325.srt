1
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,750
You and I go hard, at each other like we going to war

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,930
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,080
You and I get sore, then dysfunctional we stuck keeping score

4
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,120
You and I get sick, they all know that we can't do this no more

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,590
But baby there you again, there you again making me love you

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,760
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go

7
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,100
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo

8
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,780
And now i'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

9
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:56,370
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,730
that i'll only stay with you one more night

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,760
And I know i've said it a million times

12
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,060
But i'll only stay with you one more night

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,340
Trying to tell you no, but my body keeps on telling you yes

14
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,510
Trying to tell you stop, but your lipstick got me so out of breath

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,670
I'd be waking up, in the morning probably hating myself

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,840
And i'd be waking up, feeling sastified but guilty as hell

17
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,620
But baby there you again, there you again making me love you

18
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,780
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head let it all go

19
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,700
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo

20
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:53,050
And now i'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

21
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,150
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die,

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,250
