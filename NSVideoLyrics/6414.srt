1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
Here we go, life's little lessons

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,590
Sometimes I mess up my intentions

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:10,900
I get lost; the cost was losing everything I've known

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,340
Laying here, staring at the ceiling

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,090
Sometimes still dealing with the feelings

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,280
Of where I've been, what I've done, I'm so far out there on my own

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,030
So quick to point the finger, to find the one to blame

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,150
So hard to realize I kept getting in my own way

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:37,720
I never thought that I was that strong

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,460
To carry on, carry on tonight

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,970
Forgiveness in your eyes with nothing to hide

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:53,840
All I know is you've shown me it's a beautiful world

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,210
Oh, it's a beautiful world, oh

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,330
No more fearing my reflection

15
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,210
Here I am with these imperfections

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,220
You know my faults but you don't care, you take them all

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,840
Until now I was barely breathing

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,530
But you gave me something to believe in

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,400
We're writing history, life's made up of small victories

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,720
We could go round in circles and never get to here

21
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,410
So good to realize that we have nothing left to fear

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,590
I never thought that I was that strong

23
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,780
To carry on, carry on tonight

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,400
Forgiveness in your eyes with nothing to hide

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,580
All I know is you've shown me it's a beautiful world

26
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,590
Oh, it's a beautiful world, oh

27
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,540
So quick to point the finger when it was me to blame

28
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,230
So hard to realize I kept getting in my own way

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,730
I never thought that I was that strong

30
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,980
To carry on, carry on tonight

31
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,760
Forgiveness in your eyes with nothing to hide

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,570
All I know is you've shown me it's a beautiful world

33
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:48,380
Oh, these stars aligned, let's watch them shine for you and I

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh, these open skies, can we just lie here a while?

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,630
In this beautiful world

36
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:08,250
I never thought that I was that strong

37
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,320
To carry on but it's a beautiful world

38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:23,320
It's a beautiful world
