1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,120
This was never the way I planned

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,990
Not my intention

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:18,250
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:26,030
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,820
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:40,410
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:47,780
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,530
It felt so wrong
It felt so right

9
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,200
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,780
I kissed a girl and I liked it

11
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,940
I liked it

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:13,560
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,040
You're my experimental game
Just human nature

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,550
It's not what, good girls do

15
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,500
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused

16
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,140
Hard to obey

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,060
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick

18
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:50,370
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,570
It felt so wrong
It felt so right

20
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,030
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

21
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,740
I kissed a girl and I liked it

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,830
I liked it

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,180
Us girls we are so magical

24
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,090
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable

25
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,590
Hard to resist so touchable

26
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,250
Too good to deny it

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,070
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

28
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,910
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick

29
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:42,350
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

30
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,320
It felt so wrong
It felt so right

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,870
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

32
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,750
I kissed a girl and I liked it

33
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,620
I liked it
