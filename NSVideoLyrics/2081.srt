1
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,960
Everybody's laughing in my mind

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,020
Rumors spreading 'bout this other guy

3
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,890
Do you do what you did

4
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,570
When you did with me?

5
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,940
Does he love you the way I can?

6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,750
Did you forget all the plans

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,880
That you made with me?

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,580
'Cause baby I didn't

9
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,490
That should be me

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,240
Holding your hand

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,920
That should be me

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,790
Making you laugh

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,350
That should be me

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,160
This is so sad

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,340
That should be me

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,970
Feeling your kiss

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,780
That should be me

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,400
Buying you gifts

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,960
This is so wrong

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,710
I can't go on

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,010
Till you believe

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,260
That should be me

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,520
That should be me

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,550
You said you needed

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,730
A little time for my mistakes

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,920
It's funny how you use that time

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,030
To have me replaced

28
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,280
But did you think that

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,780
I wouldn't see you out at the movies?

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,400
Whatcha doin' to me?

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,210
You're taking him where we used to go

32
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,890
Now if you're trying to break my heart

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,260
It's working 'cause you know

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,570
That should be me

35
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,320
Holding your hand

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
That should be me

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,630
Making you laugh

38
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,370
That should be me

39
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,060
This is so sad

40
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,240
That should be me

41
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Feeling your kiss

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,670
That should be me

43
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,420
Buying you gifts

44
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,100
This is so wrong

45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,850
I can't go on

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,100
Till you believe

47
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,280
That should be me

48
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,840
I need to know should I fight

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,390
for our love for this long

50
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,450
It's getting harder to shield

51
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,560
This pain in my heart

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
That should be me

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,990
Holding your hand

54
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,680
That should be me

55
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
Making you laugh

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
That should be me

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,850
This is so sad

58
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,030
That should be me

59
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,660
Feeling your kiss

60
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,400
That should be me

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,090
Buying you gifts

62
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,840
This is so wrong

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
I can't go on

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,830
Till you believe

65
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,450
That should be me

66
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,370

That should be me

70
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,360
(That should be me giving you flowers)

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,540
That should be me

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,220
Talking by hours

73
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,220
That should be me

74
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,400
Never shoulda let you go
