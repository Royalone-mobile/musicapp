1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:10,580
It's not so easy loving me

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,530
It gets so complicated

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,410
All the things you gotta be

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,270
Everything's changing

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,450
But you're the truth

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,810
I'm amazed by all your patience

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,030
Everything I put you through

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,970
And when I'm about to fall

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,100
Somehow you're always waiting with

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,280
Your open arms to catch me

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,960
You're gonna save me from myself

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,350
From myself, yes

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:11,500
You're gonna save me from myself

14
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,660
My love is tainted by your touch

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,860
Well some guys have shown me aces

16
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,820
But you've got that royal flush

17
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,080
I know it's crazy everyday

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,270
Well tomorrow maybe shaky

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,440
But you never turn away

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,920
Don't ask me why I'm crying

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,350
'Cause when I start to crumble

22
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,770
You know how to keep me smiling

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:57,250
You always save me from myself

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,730
From myself, myself

25
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:09,830
You're gonna save me from myself

26
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,910
I know it's hard, it's hard

27
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:22,180
But you've broken all my walls

28
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,040
You've been my strength, so strong

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,540
And don't ask me why I love you

30
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,220
It's obvious you tenderness

31
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,430
Is what I need to make me

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:50,730
A better woman to myself

33
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,980
To myself, myself

34
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:11,790
You're gonna save me from myself
