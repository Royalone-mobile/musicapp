1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,810
Everybody
see's it's you

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm the one
that lost the view

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,600
Everybody says
we're through

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,230
I hope you
hadn't said it too

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,670
So where do
we go from here?

6
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,250
With all this
fear in our eyes

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,340
And where can
love take us now?

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,330
We've been
so far down

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,030
We can still
touch the sky

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,030
If we crawl,
Till we can walk again

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,990
Then we'll run

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,770
Until we're
strong enough to jump

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,670
Then we'll fly

14
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,810
Until there is no wind

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,820
So let's crawl,
crawl

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,490
Back to love,

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,860
Back to love,

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,230
Why did
I change the pace?

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,820
Hearts were never
meant to race

20
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,540
I always felt
the need for space

21
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,960
But now
I can't reach your face

22
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,980
So where are
you standing now?

23
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,100
Are you in the
crowd of my vouch?

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,890
Love,
can you see my hand?

25
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,780
I need one
more chance

26
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,310
We can still
have it all

27
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,970
So we'll crawl,

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,520
Till we can
walk again

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,330
Then we'll run,

30
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,120
Until we're strong
enough to jump

31
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,350
Then we'll fly
until there is no wind

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,150
So let's crawl,
crawl

33
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,760
Back to love,

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,280
Back to love,

35
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,990
Everybody see's
it's you

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,980
Well I never wanna
lose that view

37
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,620
So we'll crawl,
if we crawl

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,000
Till we can
walk again

39
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,200
Then we'll run,
we'll run

40
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,690
Until we're strong
enough to jump

41
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,840
Then we'll fly,
Until there is no wind

42
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,740
So let's crawl,
crawl

43
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,520
So we'll crawl,

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,210
Till we can walk again,

45
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,720
Then we'll run,
we'll run

46
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,700
Until we're strong
enough to jump

47
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,680
Then we'll fly,
Until there is no wind

48
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,830
So let's crawl,
let's crawl,

49
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,220
Back to love
