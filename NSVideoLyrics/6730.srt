1
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,840
Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys,

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,460
playin with bombs like kids play with toys.

3
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,970
One warm December,

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,220
our hearts will see,

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,690
a world where men are free.

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,410
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars

7
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,470
when we have learned what Christmas is for.

8
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,480
When we have found what life's really worth,

9
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,620
there'll be peace on Earth.

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,010
Someday all our dreams will come to be

11
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,920
someday in the world where men are free.

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,630
Baby not in time for you and me

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,980
but someday at Christmas time.
