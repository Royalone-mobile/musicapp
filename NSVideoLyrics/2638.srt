1
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:16,013
As long as you love me

2
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:30,300
Although loneliness \Nhas always been a friend of mine

3
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:34,796
I'm leavin' my life in your hands

4
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:40,203
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind

5
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,877
Risking it all in a glance

6
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,100
And how you got me blind is still a mystery

7
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:53,909
I can't get you out of my head

8
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:59,578
Don't care what is written in your history

9
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:03,153
As long as you're here with me

10
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,299
I don't care who you are

11
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:08,891
Where you're from

12
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:11,549
What you did

13
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,155
As long as you love me

14
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,746
Who you are

15
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:18,975
Where you're from

16
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,379
Don't care what you did

17
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,484
As long as you love me

18
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:29,009
Every little thing \Nthat you have said and done

19
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:33,047
Feels like it's deep within me

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,744
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run

21
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:42,506
It seems like we're meant to be

22
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,584
I don't care who you are

23
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,108
Where you're from

24
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,626
What you did

25
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:53,445
As long as you love me \N (I don't know)

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,638
Who you are

27
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:57,842
Where you're from

28
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:00,547
Don't care what you did

29
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:03,418
As long as you love me (yeah)

30
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,263
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows

31
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19,964
But I guess it shows

32
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:23,616
When you look into my eyes

33
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:27,592
What you did and where you're comin from

34
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:33,619
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

35
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:44,669
I don't care who you are

36
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,699
Where you're from

37
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,241
What you did

38
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:52,237
As long as you love me

39
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,564
Who you are

40
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,099
Where you're from

41
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,042
Don't care what you did (yeah)

42
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:02,155
As long as you love me

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,707
Who you are

44
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:07,528
Where you're from

45
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,441
What you did

46
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:13,231
As long as you love me

47
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,870
Who you are

48
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,672
Where you're from

49
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:22,117
As long as you love me

50
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:24,291
Who you are

51
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:26,555
As long as you love me

52
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,525
What you did \N(I don't care)
