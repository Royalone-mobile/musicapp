1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,580
Oh oh , oh oh...

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,600
So much for my happy ending.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,360
Oh oh , oh oh...

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,250
So much for my happy ending.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,580
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,080
Let's talk this over

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,530
It's not like we're dead

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,550
Was it something I did?

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,570
Was it something You said?

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,520
Don't leave me hanging

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,920
In a city so dead

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,540
Held up so high

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,460
On such a breakable thread

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,590
You were all the things

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,330
I thought I knew

16
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,590
And I thought we could be

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,070
You were everything,

18
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,850
everything that I wanted

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,530
We were meant to be,

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,650
supposed to be, but we lost it.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,280
And all the memories,

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,130
so close to me,
just fade away

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,730
All this time you
were pretending

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,700
So much for
my happy ending.

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,520
Oh oh, oh oh...

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,420
So much for
my happy ending.

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,020
Oh oh, oh oh...

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,040
You've got
your dumb friends

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
I know what they say

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,580
They tell you I'm difficult

31
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,930
But so are they

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,170
But they don't know me

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,430
Do they even know you?

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,820
All the things
you hide from me

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,160
All the shit that you do

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,460
You were all the things

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,400
I thought I knew

38
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,470
And I thought
we could be

39
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,890
You were everything,

40
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,800
everything that I wanted.

41
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,320
We were meant to be,

42
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,510
supposed to be,
but we lost it.

43
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,040
And all the memories,

44
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,030
so close to me,
just fade away

45
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,460
All this time
you were pretending

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,520
So much for
my happy ending.

47
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,670
It's nice to know
you were there

48
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,530
Thanks for acting
like you cared

49
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,620
And making me feel like

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,260
I was the only one.

51
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,080
It's nice to know
we had it all

52
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,900
Thanks for
watching as I fall

53
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,730
And letting me know
we were done.

54
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,980
You were everything,

55
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,180
everything that I wanted

56
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,560
We were meant to be,

57
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,370
supposed to be,
but we lost it

58
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,170
And all the memories,

59
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,440
so close to me,
just fade away

60
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,690
All this time
you were pretending

61
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,170
So much for
my happy ending.

62
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,610
You were everything,

everything that I wanted

64
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,270
We were meant to be,

65
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,170
supposed to be,
but we lost it

66
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,930
And all the memories,

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,970
so close to me,
just fade away

68

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,420
So much for
my happy ending.
