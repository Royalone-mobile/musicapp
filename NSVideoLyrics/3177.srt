1
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,460
Notice me

2
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,650
Take my hand

3
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,770
Why are we

4
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,020
Strangers when

5
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,400
Our love is strong

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,830
Why carry on without me?

7
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,090
Everytime I try to fly

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,400
I fall Without my wings

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,960
I feel so small

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,710
I guess I need you Baby

11
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,340
And everytime I see you in my dreams

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,520
I see your face

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,080
It's haunting me

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:26,240
I guess I need you Baby

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,620
I make believe

16
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,930
That you are here

17
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,490
It's the only way

18
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,560
I see clear

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,990
What have I done?

20
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,040
You seemed to move on easy

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,440
And everytime I try to fly

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,930
I fall without my wings

23
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,560
I feel so small

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,310
I guess I need you Baby

25
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,960
And everytime I see you in my dreams

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,090
I see your face

27
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,650
You're haunting me

28
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,950
I guess I need you Baby

29
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,270
I may have made it rain

30
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,580
Please forgive me

31
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,960
My weakness caused you pain

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:58,830
And this song is my sorry

33
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,980
At night I pray

34
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,480
That soon your face will fade away

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,610
And everytime I try to fly

36
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,990
I fall without my wings

37
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,610
I feel so small

38
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,360
I guess I need you Baby

39
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,050
And everytime I see you in my dreams

40
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,110
I see your face

41
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,800
You're haunting me

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I guess I need you baby
