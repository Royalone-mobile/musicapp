1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
I'm sitting here along up in my room

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,500
And thinking about the times that we've been through (oh my love)

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm looking at a picture in my hand

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Trying my best to understand

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
I really want to know what we did wrong

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,500
With a love that felt so strong

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,500
If only you were here tonight

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I know that we could make it right

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
I don't know how to live without your love

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
I was born to make you happy

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
'Cause you're the only one within my heart

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
I was born to make you happy

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Always and forever

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
you and me

15
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
That's the way our life should be

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
I don't know how to live without your love

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
I was born to make you happy

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,500
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,500
I'd better give it up and carry on (oh my love)

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
'Cause living in a dream of you and me

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Is not the way my life should be

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
I don't want to cry a tear for you

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,500
So forgive me if I do

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,500
If only you were here tonight

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
I know that we could make it right

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
I don't know how to live without your love

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I was born to make you happy

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
'Cause you're the only one within my heart

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I was born to make you happy

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Always and forever

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
you and me

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
That's the way our life should be

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
I don't know how to live without your love

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
I was born to make you happy

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,500
I'd do anything' I'd give you my world

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,500
I'd wait forever' to be your girl

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Just call out my name' and I will be there

38
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Just to show you how much I care

39
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I don't know how to live without your love

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I was born to make you happy

41
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
'Cause you're the only one within my heart

Always and forever

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
you and me

45
