1
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,690
Are you aware of
what you make me feel, baby?

2
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,170
Right now I feel
invisible to you

3
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,960
Like I'm not real

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,090
Didn't you feel me
lock my arms around you?

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,860
Why'd you
turn away?

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,140
Here's what
I have to say

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,970
I was left
to cry there

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,190
Waiting
outside there

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,770
Grinning with
the lost stare

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,860
That's
when I decided

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,770
Why should
I care?

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,120
'Cause you
weren't there

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,810
When I was scared

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,760
I was so alone

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,750
You, you need
to listen

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,150
I'm starting
to trip

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,730
I'm losing
my grip

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,520
And I'm in this
thing alone

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,170
Am I just some chick
you place beside you

20
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,530
to take
somebody's place?

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,700
When you turn around
can you recognize my face?

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,350
You used
to love me

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,110
You used
to hug me

24
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,980
But that
wasn't the case

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,760
Everything
wasn't ok

26
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,390
I was left
to cry there

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,880
Waiting
outside there

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,620
Grinning
with the lost stare

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
That's
when I decided

30
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,620
Why should
I care?

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,780
'Cause you
weren't there

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,400
When I was scared

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,510
I was so alone

34
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,390
You, you need
to listen

35
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,850
I'm starting
to trip

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,430
I'm losing
my grip

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,520
And I'm in this
thing alone

38
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,430
Crying out loud

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,450
I'm crying out loud

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,300
Crying out loud

41
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,680
I'm crying out loud

42
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,120
Open your eyes

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,760
Open up wide

44
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,830
Why should
I care?

45
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,400
'Cause you
weren't there

46
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
When
I was scared

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,800
I was so alone

48
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,560
Why should
I care?

49
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,520
'Cause you
weren't there

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,140
When
I was scared

51
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,880
I was so alone

52
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,560
Why should
I care?

53
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,630
If you
don't care

54
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,260
Then I
don't care

55
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,270
We're not
going anywhere

56
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,030
Why should
I care?

57
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,680
'Cause you
weren't there

58
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,360
When
I was scared

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,290
I was so alone

60
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,730
Why should
I care?

61
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,840
If you
don't care

62
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,310
Then I
don't care

63
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,460
We're not
going anywhere

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
