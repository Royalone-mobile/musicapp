00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,380
Days like this I want to drive away
2
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,200
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,030
You chewed me up and spit me out,
4
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,820
Like I was poison in your mouth
5
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,880
You took my light, you drink me down
6
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,360
That was then and this is now
7
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,500
Now look at me !
8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,530
This is the part of me
9
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,370
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
10
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,010
This is the part of me
11
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,650
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
12
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,350
Throw sticks and these stones. Throw your bombs and glows
13
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,080
But you're not gonna break my soul
14
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,780
This is the part of me
15
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,800
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
16
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:43,410
I just wanna throw my phone away
17
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:49,250
Find out who is really there for me
18
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,190
You ripped me off, your love was cheap,
19
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,140
It's always tearing at the seams,
20
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,760
I fell deep and you let me down,
21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,470
But that was then and this is now
22
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,680
Now look at me !
23
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,750
This is the part of me
24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,440
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,010
This is the part of me
26
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,860
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
27
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,650
Throw sticks and these stones. Throw your bombs and glows
28
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,200
But you're not gonna break my soul
29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,750
This is the part of me
30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,520
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
31
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,610
And look at me, I'm sparkling
32
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,390
A firework, a dancing flame
33
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,140
You won't ever put me out again
34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,750
I'm glowing ohohoh
35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,230
So you can keep the diamond ring
36
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,020
It don't mean nothing anyway
37
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,520
In fact you can keep everything
38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,590
Yeah, yeah
39
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,140
Except for me
40
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,390
 
41
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,660
This is the part of me
42
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,500
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,070
This is the part of me
44
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,850
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
45
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,690
Throw sticks and these stones. Throw your bombs and glows
46
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,340
But you're not gonna break my soul
47
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,880
This is the part of me
48
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,150
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
49
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,330
This is the part of me
50
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,020
This is the part of me, no, (away from me)
51
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,660
This is the part of me
52
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,380
This is the part of me, me, me, me, me, me, no
53
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,080
Throw sticks and these stones. Throw your bombs and glows
54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,670
But you're not gonna break my soul
55
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,420
This is the part of me
56
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:09,420
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
