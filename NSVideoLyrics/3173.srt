1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,390
It's been a while

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,190
I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:17,010
But I'm here now

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,190
I know it's been a while

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,060
But I'm glad you came

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,230
And I've been thinking 'bout

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,290
How you say my name

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,160
Got my body spinning

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,460
Like a hurricane

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,390
And it feels like

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,130
You got me going insane

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,380
And I can't get enough

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,330
So let me get it up

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:34,810
Ooh, looks like we're alone now

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,250
You ain't gotta be scared

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:38,870
Where you going now?

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,990
I'm a have to floss on you

18
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,220
Let's get it blazin'

19
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,090
We can turn the heat up if you wanna

20
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,270
Turn the lights down low if you wanna

21
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,890
Just wanna move you

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,070
But you're frozen

23
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,310
That's what I'm saying

24
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,550
Let me break the ice

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,930
Allow me to get you right

26
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,170
But you warm up to me

27
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,160
Baby I can make you feel

28
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,020
Let me break the ice

29
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,010
Allow me to get you right

30
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,510
But you warm up to me

31
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:09,280
Baby I can make you feel

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,080
So you warming up yet?

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,070
You got me hypnotised

34
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,120
I never felt this way

35
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,790
Got my heart beating

36
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,850
Like an 808

37
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,150
Can you rise to the occasion?

38
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,450
I'm patiently waiting

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,070
Cause it's getting late

40
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,820
And I can't get enough

41
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,370
So let me get it up

42
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,860
Ooh, looks like we're alone now

43
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,300
You ain't gotta be scared

44
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,720
Where you going now?

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,410

46
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,400
Let's get it blazin'

We can turn the heat up if you wanna

48
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,000
Turn the lights down low if you wanna

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,060
Just wanna move you

50
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,000
But you're frozen

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,300
That's what I'm saying

52
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,790
Let me break the ice

53
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,790
Allow me to get you right

54
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,030
But you warm up to me

55
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,140
Baby I can make you feel

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,880
Let me break the ice

57
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,870
Allow me to get you right

Baby I can make you feel

60
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:11,310
I like this part

61
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,850
Feels kinda good

62
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,350

63
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,320
Let me break the ice

64
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,310
