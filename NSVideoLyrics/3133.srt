1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,143
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:15,616
She's going off about something that you said

3
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:21,595
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

4
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:26,888
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night

5
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:30,623
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like

6
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:36,065
And she'll never know your story like I do

7
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,321
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts

8
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:45,053
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

9
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,205
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,879
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

11
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:56,106
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

12
00:00:56,141 --> 00:01:02,086
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

13
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:07,614
You, you belong with me, you belong with me

14
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:15,002
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans

15
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:18,537
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be

16
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:22,554
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself

17
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:25,547
Hey, isn't this easy?

18
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:29,529
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

19
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:33,270
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down

20
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:36,549
You say you're fine, I know you better than that

21
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:40,333
Hey, what ya doing with a girl like that?

22
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:44,111
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers

23
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,737
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

24
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:50,942
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find

25
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,590
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

26
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:58,875
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

27
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,678
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

28
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:09,797
You belong with me

29
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:13,605
Standing by and waiting at your back door

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,252
All this time how could you not know?

31
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:25,816
Baby, you belong with me, you belong with me

32
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:42,716
Oh, I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night

33
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:46,444
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry

34
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,163
And I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams

35
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:55,253
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

36
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:59,755
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?

37
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,851
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

38
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:10,723
You belong with me

39
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:14,536
Standing by and waiting at your back door

40
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:17,842
All this time, how could you not know?

41
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:26,247
Baby, you belong with me, you belong with me

42
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:30,402
You belong with me

43
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:35,636
Have you ever thought just maybe

44
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:39,345
You belong with me?

45
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,303
You belong with me

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
