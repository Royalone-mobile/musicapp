1
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:15,386
Baby, oh

2
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:23,519
Even in my heart I see

3
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:27,951
You're not bein' true to me

4
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:33,044
Deep within my soul I feel

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,385
Nothing's like it used to be

6
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:42,921
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time

7
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:47,090
Impossible as it may seem

8
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:55,702
But I wish I could so bad, baby

9
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:59,915
Quit playin' games with my heart

10
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,160
Quit playin' games with my heart

11
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:11,215
I should've known from the start

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,412
Quit playin' games with my heart

13
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:21,292
I live my life the way

14
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:25,584
To keep you comin' back to me

15
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,874
Everything I do is for you

16
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,014
So what is it that you can't see

17
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,544
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time

18
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,620
Impossible as it may seem

19
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:53,186
But I wish I could so bad, baby

20
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:57,059
You better quit playin' games with my heart

21
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:03,479
Quit playin' games with my heart

22
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:08,172
I should've known from the start

23
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,609
Quit playin' games with my heart

24
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:21,007
Baby, baby the love that we had was so strong

25
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:24,413
Don't leave me hangin' here forever

26
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:31,331
Oh baby, baby this is not right, let's stop this tonight

27
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:44,049
Baby, (oh) quit playin' games

28
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:50,915
Baby

29
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,843
Sometimes I wish I could

30
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,532
Turn back time, impossible as it may seem

31
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:10,031
But I wish I could so bad, baby

32
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:13,389
Quit playin' games with my heart

33
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:20,236
Quit playin' games with my heart

34
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:23,624
I should've known from the start

35
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,419
Quit playin' games with my heart

36
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:30,179
Quit playin' games with my heart

37
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:36,900
Baby

38
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,302
Quit playin' games with my heart

39
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:45,661
(my heart)

40
00:03:45,696 --> 00:03:49,044
Baby (my heart)

41
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,925
With my heart
