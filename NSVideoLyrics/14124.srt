00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:59,233
But the very next day you gave it away

3
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:03,938
This year to save me from tears

4
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,838
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy

13

I keep my distance

14
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:56,418
But you still catch my eye

15
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,052
Tell me baby

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,359
Do you recognize me?

With a note saying "I Love You, I Mean It"

22
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:18,050
Now I know what a fool I've been

23
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:20,514
But if you kissed me now

24
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,397
I know you'd fool me again

25
