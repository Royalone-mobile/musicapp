1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,060
The day I first met you

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,300
You told me you'd never fall in love

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,210
But now that I get you

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,870
I know fear is what it really was

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,750
Now here we are, so close, yet so far

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,190
Haven't I passed the test?

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,970
When will you realize?

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,540
Baby i'm not like the rest

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,570
Don't wanna break your heart

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,440
Wanna give your heart a break

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,320
I know you're scared it's wrong

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,300
Like you might make a mistake

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,270
There's just one life to live

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,280
And there's no time to waste (to waste)

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,270
So let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,160
Let me give your heart a break , your heart a break

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,130
oh yeah yeah

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,900
On Sunday, you went home alone,

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,870
There were tears in your eyes,

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,500
I called your cell phone, my love,

21
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,580
But you did not reply

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,470
The world is ours if we want it,

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,680
We can take it, if you just take my hand,

24
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,990
There's no turning back now

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,090
Baby try to understand

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,100
Don't wanna break your heart

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,150
Wanna give your heart a break

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,930
I know you're scared it's wrong

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,990
Like you might make a mistake

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,870
There's just one life to live

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,970
And there's no time to waste (to waste)

32
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,910
So let me give your heart a break, your heart a break,

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,490
Let me give your heart a break , your heart a break

34
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,620
There's just so much you can take, give your heart a break

35
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,360
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break

36
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,530
(oh yeah yeah)

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,130
When your lips are on my lips

38
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,070
and our hearts beat as one,

39
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,900
But you slip out of my finger tips

40
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:26,880
Everytime you run

41
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,640
Don't wanna break your heart,

42
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,760
Wanna give your heart a break,

43
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,690
I know you're scared it's wrong,

44
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,600
Like you might make a mistake

45
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,580
There's just one life to live,

46
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,480
And there's no time to waste (to waste)

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,670
So let me give your heart a break,

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,440
'cause you've been hurt before,

49
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,310
I can see it in your eyes

50
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,070
You try to smile it away,

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,070
Some things you can't disguise

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,380
Don't wanna break your heart, maybe I can ease the ache (the ache)

53
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,030
So let me give your heart a break,give your heart a break,

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,020

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,210
The day I first met you

59
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,950
You told me you'd never fall in love

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:35,000
