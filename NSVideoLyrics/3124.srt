1
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,120
I'm so glad you made time to see me

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,500
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,300
I haven't seen them in a while

4
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,600
You've been good; busier than ever

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,030
We small talk, work in the weather

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,840
Your guard is up and I know why

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,580
Cause the last time you saw me

8
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,580
Still burns in the back of your mind

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:00,290
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,670
So this is me swallowing my pride,

11
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,880
Standing in front of you saying

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,710
I'm sorry for that night

13
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,340
And I go back to December all the time,

14
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,090
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you

15
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,400
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine

16
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,420
And I go back to December,

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,820
Turn around and make it all right

18
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,880
I go back to December all the time

19
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,960
These days I haven't been sleepin',

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,380
Stayin' up playing back myself leavin',

21
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,180
When your birthday passed and I didn't call,

22
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,330
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times,

23
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,860
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side

24
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,860
And realized I loved you in the fall

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,650
And then the cold came, with the dark days

26
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,480
When the fear crept into my mind

27
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,370
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,560
So this is me swallowing my pride,

29
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,730
Standing in front of you saying

30
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,490
I'm sorry for that night

31
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,250
And I go back to December all the time,

32
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,000
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,280
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine

34
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,320
And I go back to December,

35
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,700
Turn around and change my own mind

36
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,040
I go back to December all the time

37
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,260
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile,

38
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,940
So good to me, so right

39
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,710
And how you held me in your arms that September night;

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,450
The first time you ever saw me cry

41
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,420
Maybe this is wishful thinking

42
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,700
Probably mindless dreaming

43
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,240
If we loved again, I swear I'd love you right

44
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,550
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't

45
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,110
So if the chain is on your door I understand

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,380
But this is me swallowing my pride,

47
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,570
Standing in front of you saying

48
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,480
I'm sorry for that night

49
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,830
And I go back to December

50
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,690
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you

51
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,130
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine

52
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,020
I go back to December,

53
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,400
Turn around and make it all right

54
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,770
I go back to December

55
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,160
Turn around and change my own mind

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,990
I go back to December all the time

57
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,820
All the time
