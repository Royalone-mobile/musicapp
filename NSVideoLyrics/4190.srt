1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,760
Bring the beat in!

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,900
Honey,

3
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,980
I can see the stars
all the way from here

4
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,300
Can't you see the glow
on the window pane?

5
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,160
I can feel the sun
whenever you're near

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,180
Everytime you touch me
I just melt away

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,220
Now everybody ask me
why I'm smiling up from ear to ear

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,560
They say that love hurts,
but I know

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,460
It's gonna take
the real work

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,910
Nothing's perfect
but it's worth it

11
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,290
After fighting
through my tears

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,790
And finally
you put me first

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,130
Baby it's you,
you're the one I love

14
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,650
You're the one
I need

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,180
You're the only one
I see

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,740
Come on baby,
it's you

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,210
You're the one
that gives your all

18
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,630
You're the one
I can always call

19
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,930
When I need you,
you make everything stop

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,530
Finally,
you put my love on top

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,780
Come on,
baby

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,960
You put my love
on top

23
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,660
You put my love
on top

24
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,290
Come on,
baby

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,900
You put my love
on top

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,710
Top,
you put my love on top

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,970
Baby it's you,
you're the one I love
