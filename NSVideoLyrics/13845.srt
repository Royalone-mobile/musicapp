1
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,152
I cry many times at night

2
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,333
Think about you all the time

3
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:28,469
Your voice is on my mind it hurts so much inside

4
00:00:28,746 --> 00:00:30,837
Even though we try and try

5
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:33,120
Break up to make up gets tired

6
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:36,869
Always mad at you, you’re mad at me, time to say goodbye

7
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:40,774
Our love ,Ain’t strong,

8
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,231
Couldn’t survive thru all these struggles

9
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:45,358
Couldn’t never last too many troubles

10
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:49,468
Can’t stand, the pain

11
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:51,847
You cried for me, I cried for you babe

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,397
Couldn’t believe all things we use to do

13
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:56,899
One thing stays on my mind

14
00:00:57,164 --> 00:00:59,065
The look that was in your eyes

15
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,204
Why couldn’t I see at that time

16
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:03,523
That you loved me and you tried

17
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:05,682
Now you’re gone I ain’t mad at you

18
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:07,823
Never wanted to let you go

19
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:10,059
I wish I could hold you again

20
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:12,099
But its too late, now baby I know

21
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:15,603
Our love ,Ain’t strong,

22
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,153
Couldn’t survive thru all these struggles

23
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:20,316
Couldn’t never last too many troubles

24
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:24,614
Can’t stand, the pain

25
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,740
You cried for me, I cried for you babe

26
00:01:27,074 --> 00:01:29,719
Couldn’t believe all things we use to do

27
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,139
Look into my eyes

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,026
What do you see?

29
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:44,058
All I see is the hatred

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,186
Isn’t that what you told me

31
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:50,681
Why am I crying bout you and I

32
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:52,724
