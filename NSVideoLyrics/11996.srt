1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,870
I know it ain't fair

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,170
The only ball I drop

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,690
New Years', Times Square,

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,370
The world is mine

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,450
Sixth Sense

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,390
I see the seven signs

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,380
Now baby,

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,700
Let's get started for life

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,700
Everytime I look into your eyes

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,150
(Mr Worldwide)

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,770
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,290
We can get started for life

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:40,710
Tonight

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,940

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,200

We can get started

23
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,470
You know it feels right

24
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,120
Big news, Pitbull

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,460
All lit up like a December night,

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,120
Tom Cruise, Mumbai

27
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,620
Like the 4th of July, Vanilla Sky

28
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,610
Thrilla in Manilla

29
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,810
Knockin' 'em out like Pacquiao

30
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,230
New Ali, new Frazier

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,450
But for now it's off to Malaysia

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,630
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,140
Now that's worldwide,

34
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,030
If you think it's a game let's play !Dale¡

35
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,080
Everytime I look into your eyes

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,880
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,890
Tonight

41
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,170
For life

We can get started

48
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,030
You know it feels right

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,330
I am what they thought I'd never become,

50
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,050
I believed and became it,

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,860
Now I'm here to claim it

52
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,750
I hustle anything, you name it

53
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,440
I went from evictions to food stamps,

54
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,340
To back in work, what damn (?)

55
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,700
To a passport, flooded with stamps

56
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,420
Now slowly, everywhere I land

57
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,340
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day

58
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,910
Now that's worldwide,

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,010
If you think it's a game let's play !Dale¡

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:46,800
Cause if it feels right, we shouldn't waste any more time,

61
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,360
Let's get it started, don't think about it

62
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,210
You know I'm gonna make it alright, alright

63
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,650
Cause if it feels right,

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,830
You know I've made up my mind

65
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,270
Let's get it started, don't think about it

66
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,000
I know that we can make it alright alright

67
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,650
Everytime I look into your eyes

Don't start what you can't finish

81

You know it feels right
