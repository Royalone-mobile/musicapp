1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
"Never look back,"

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we said

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How was I to know

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'd miss you so?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Loneliness up ahead,

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
emptiness behind

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Where do I go?

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And you didn't hear

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
All my joy through my tears

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
All my hopes through my fears

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Did you know

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Still I miss you somehow

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
From the bottom of my broken heart

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's just a thing

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
or two I'd like you to know

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You were my first love,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you were my true love

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
From the first kisses to

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the very last rose

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
From the bottom of my broken heart

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Even though time may

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
find me somebody new

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You were my real love,

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I never knew love

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
'Til there was you

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
From the bottom of my broken heart

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
"Baby," I said,

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
"please stay.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Give our love a chance

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
for one more day"

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We could have worked things out

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Taking time is

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
what love is all about

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But you put a dart

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Through my dreams

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
through my heart

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I'm back where I

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
started again

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Never thought it would end

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
From the bottom of my broken heart

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There's just a thing

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
or two I'd like you to know

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You were my first love,

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,500
I never knew love

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
'Til there was you

46
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
From the bottom of my broken heart

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
You promised yourself

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
But to somebody else

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
And you made it so

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,500
perfectly clear

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Still I wish you were here

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,500
From the bottom of my broken heart

53
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
There's just a thing

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,500
or two I'd like you to know

55
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
You were my first love,

56
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,500
you were my true love

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
From the first kisses to

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,500
the very last rose

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,500
From the bottom of my broken heart

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Even though time may

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
find me somebody new

62
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
You were my real love,

63
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
I never knew love

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
'Til there was you

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,500
From the bottom of my broken heart

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
"Never look back,"

67
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
we said

68
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
How was I to know

69
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:31,500
I'd miss you so?
