1
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:27,761
Ain't this what you came for

00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:30,439
Don't you wish you came, oh

3
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,023
Girl what you're playing for

00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,446
Come on, let me kiss that

5
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:41,014
Ooh, I know you miss that

00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:28,664
The best you ever had

16
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,800
I hit you with the best flow,

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,528
Freestlying in the restroom

18
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:37,121
Til you blowing cigarette smoke

19
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:39,825
And now the bad's gone

20

Work it out, then we cool down

23
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:48,974
Cool down

24
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:54,141
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know

25

29
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:23,144
The best you ever had

30
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:27,929
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be

31
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:32,041
The best you ever had

32
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:33,506
Luda, listen...

33
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,449
You ain't even gotta text me

34
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,808
Knowin' me and you got that mental telepathy

35
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:38,928
Me be up at the spot,

36
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:39,920
I'll be sending over the chauffeur

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,048
Rich nigga bread, stay poppin' like a toaster

38
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,537
Nobody come close to me and you together

39
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,201
Step under my umbrella, weâ€™ll make it through any weather

40
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:50,753
Except when I make it storm, sex in the greatest form

41
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,177
And hibernate under my body

42
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:54,887
Yep I keep it warmer than a chinchilla

43
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:57,472
She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manila

44
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:00,128
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,544
Than throw you on a grill

46
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:04,271
Cause seven days a week youâ€™re my 5 course meal

47
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:05,311
For real!

48
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,887
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know

49
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:14,184
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control

50
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:20,223
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that

51
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:25,935
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

52
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:32,701
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be

53
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:37,837
The best you ever had

54
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:43,038
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be

55
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:48,261
The best you ever had
