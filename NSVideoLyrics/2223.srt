Don't be so quick to walk away (Dance with me)

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,710
I wanna rock your body, please stay (Dance with me)

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,340
You don't have to admit you wanna play (Dance with me)

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,030
Just let me rock you till the break of day (Dance with me)

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,220
Got time, but I don't mind

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,030
Just wanna rock you, girl

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,650
I'll have whatever you have

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,960
Come on let's give it a whirl

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,220
See, I've been watchin' you

00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,590

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,840
So go head, girl, just do it

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,960
That a** shakin' thing you do

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,530
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,900
And you all could meet me in the middle of the floor

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,340
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,720
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,150
Don't be so quick to walk away (Dance with me)

18

I wanna rock your body, please stay (Dance with me)

19

You don't have to admit you wanna play (Dance with me)

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,470
Just let me rock you till the break of day (Dance with me)

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,470

And you all could meet me in the middle of the floor

00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,840
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,220
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,840
Don't be so quick to walk away (Dance with me)
