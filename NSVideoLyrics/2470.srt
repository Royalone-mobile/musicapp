1
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,730
Back in the Ronald Reagan days

2
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,590
When we put sattelites in space

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,960
When boys wore skinny leather ties

4
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,460
Like Don Johnson from Miami Vice

5
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,590
When M&M was just a snack

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,270
And Michael Jacksons skin was black

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,210
Back when the coolest thing in store

8
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,710
Was a Commodore 64

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,770
Back to the 80's

10
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,460
Back to Soap

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,090
Back to Rocky and Cherry Coke

12
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,150
Those were the days

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,020
And we go

14
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,520
Back to the 80's

15
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,770
And hey there Mr.T

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,270

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,340
Those were the days

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,340
I come back

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,180

I Come Back

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,100
When Huey Lewis was the news

25
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,980
When we went flying with Tom Cruise

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,790
When shoulderpads and looking tough

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,450
Lost a dare to David Hasselhof

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,130
To many men with heavy makeup on

29
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,880
To many poodles with guitars

30
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,480
Thanks for all the joy you've given us

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,600
You will always be our superstars

32
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,410
