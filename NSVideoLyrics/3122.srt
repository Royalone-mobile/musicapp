1
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:20,435
We were both young when I first saw you

2
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,163
I close my eyes

3
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:23,986
And the flashback starts

4
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:27,243
I'm standing there

5
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,996
On a balcony in summer air

6
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:34,369
See the lights

7
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:36,646
See the party, the ball gowns

8
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:40,136
I see you make your way through the crowd

9
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:47,334
And say hello, little did I know

10
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,602
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

11
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:56,218
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

12
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,997
And I was crying on the staircase

13
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:04,898
Begging you please don't go, and I said

14
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:08,927
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone

15
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:13,088
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run

16
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:17,079
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

17
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:21,831
It's a love story baby just say yes

18
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,028
So I sneak out to the garden to see you

19
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:32,590
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

20
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,605
So close your eyes

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,877
Escape this town for a little while

22
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:45,032
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

23
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,656
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet

24
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,876
But you were everything to me

25
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:57,467
I was begging you please don't go and I said

26
00:01:57,502 --> 00:02:01,458
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone

27
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:05,391
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run

28
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:09,465
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,669
It's a love story baby just say yes

30
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:17,626
Romeo save me, they try to tell me how to feel

31
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:21,840
This love is difficult, but it's real

32
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,730
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess

33
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:30,900
It's a love story baby just say yes

34
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,560
Oh oh

35
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:48,756
I got tired of waiting

36
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:52,693
Wondering if you were ever coming around

37
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:57,483
My faith in you is fading

38
00:02:57,518 --> 00:03:02,055
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

39
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,967
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone

40
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:10,146
I keep waiting for you but you never come

41
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,286
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think

42
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:17,697
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

43
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,916
And said, marry me Juliet

44
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:22,213
You'll never have to be alone

45
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:26,162
I love you and that's all I really know

46
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:30,249
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

47
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:35,934
It's a love story baby just say yes

48
00:03:37,632 --> 00:03:45,086
Oh, oh, oh, oh

49
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:51,607
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

50
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:55,608
