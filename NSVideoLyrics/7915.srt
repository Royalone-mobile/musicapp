1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,040
I remember tears  streaming down your face

2
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,420
When I said, I’ll never let you go

3
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,940
When all those shadows  almost killed your light

4
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:34,450
I remember you said,  "Don’t leave me here alone"

5
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:41,000
But all that’s dead and gone  and passed tonight

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,960
Just close your eyes

7
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,790
The sun is going down

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,570
You’ll be alright

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,520
No one can hurt you now

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,630
Come morning light

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:07,590
You and I’ll be safe and sound

12
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,950
Don’t you dare look out  your window darling

13
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,530
Everything’s on fire

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,940
The war outside our door  keeps raging on

15
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,880
Hold onto this lullaby

16
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,300
Even when music’s gone

17
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,530
Gone

18
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,550
Just close your eyes

19
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,400
The sun is going down

20
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,110
You’ll be alright

21
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,080
No one can hurt you now

22
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,780
Come morning light

23
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:17,610
You and I’ll be safe and sound

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,090
Just close your eyes

25
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,380
You’ll be alright

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,140
Come morning light,

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:20,580
You and I’ll be safe and sound…
