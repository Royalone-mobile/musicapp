1
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:25,133
I can see that you've been crying

2
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:29,675
You can't hide it with a lie

3
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:36,298
What's the use in you denying

4
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:41,579
That what you have is wrong

5
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:48,412
I heard him promise you forever

6
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:54,856
But forevers come and gone

7
00:00:54,891 --> 00:01:00,020
Baby he would say whatever

8
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:05,495
It takes to keep you blind

9
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,004
To the truth between the lines

10
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:17,964
Oh I will love you more than that

11
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:24,615
I won't say those words, \Nthen take them back

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,260
Don't give loneliness a chance

13
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:34,327
Baby listen to me when I say

14
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:38,770
I will love you more than that

15
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:46,524
Baby you deserve much better

16
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:52,367
What's the use in holding on

17
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:57,265
Don't you see it's now or never

18
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,000
Coz I just can't be friends

19
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:09,152
Baby knowing in the end

20
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:14,729
That I will love you more than that

21
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:21,598
I won't say those words, \Nthen take them back

22
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:27,309
Don't give loneliness a chance

23
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:31,479
Baby listen to me when I say

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,555
There's not a day that passes by

25
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,805
I don't wonder why we haven't tried

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,599
It's not too late to change your mind

27
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:48,772
So take my hand, don't say goodbye

28
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:53,735
