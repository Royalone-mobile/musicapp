1
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,790
I need time, love, joy

2
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,270
I need space, love

3
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,240
I need me

4
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,340
Say hello to the girl that I am

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,320
You're gonna have to see through my perspective

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,200
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,460
And I don't wanna be so damn protected

8
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,200
There must be another way

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,160
'Cause I believe in taking chances, but who am I to say

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,930
What a girl is to do, God I need some answers

11
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,350
What am I to do with my life?

12
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,590
(You will find it out don't worry)

13
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,970
How am I supposed to know what's right?

14
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,520
(You just gotta do it your way)

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,350
I can't help the way I feel

16
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,360
But my life has been so overprotected

17
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,150
I tell them what I like, what I want and what I don't

18
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,130
But everytime I do, I stand corrected

19
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,880
Things that I've been told, I can't believe what I hear about the world

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,890
I realize I'm overprotected

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,150
There must be another way

22
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,840
'Cause I believe in taking chances, but who am I to say

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,680
What a girl is to do, God I need some answers

24
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,740
What am I to do with my life?

25
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,310
(You will find it out don't worry)

26
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,700
How am I supposed to know what's right?

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,240
(You just gotta do it your way)

28
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,990
I can't help the way I feel

29

30

I need time, love, I need space

31
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,110
(This is it, this is it)

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,890
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna

33
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,540
What I what what what I'm gonna do about my destiny

34
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,960
(I say no no) nobody's telling me just what I wanna (do do)

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,630
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me

36
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,660
What am I to do with my life?

37
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,020
(You will find it out don't worry)

38
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,480

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,800
