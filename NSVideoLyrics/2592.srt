1
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,110
I always needed time
on my own

2
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,060
I never thought I'd need
you there when I cry

3
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,940
And the days feel like
years when I'm alone

4
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,090
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,020
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take

6
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,850
Do you see how much
I need you right now?

7
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,810
When you're gone

8
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,040
The pieces of my heart
are missing you

9
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,560
When you're gone

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,790
The face I came to know
is missing too

11
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,270
When you're gone
All words I need to hear

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,090
to always get me
through the day

13
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:27,240
And make it ok
I miss you

14
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,100
I've never felt this
way before

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you

16
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,160
And the clothes you left,
they lie on the floor

17
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,140
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

18
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:12,120
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take

19
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,970
Do you see how much
I need you right now?

20
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,260
When you're gone

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,160
The pieces of my heart
are missing you

22
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,680
When you're gone

23
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,900
The face I came to know
is missing too

24
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,320
When you're gone
All words I need to hear

25
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,360
to always get me
through the day

26
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,290
And make it ok
I miss you

27
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,510
We were made
for each other

28
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,330
I'll keep it forever
I know we were

29
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,450
Yeah, yeah

30
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,580
And all I ever wanted
was for you to know

31
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,390
Everything I do I give
my heart and soul

32
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,470
I can hardly breathe

33
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,860
I need to feel you
here with me

34
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,100
Yeah...

35
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,130
When you're gone

36
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,240
The pieces of my heart
are missing you

37
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,600
When you're gone

38
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,960
The face I came to know
is missing too

39
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,320
When you're gone
All words I need to hear

40
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,500
to always get me
through the day

41
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:43,850
And make it ok
I miss you

42
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,050
