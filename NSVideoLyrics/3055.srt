1
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,460
Ring the alarm

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,700
I been through this too long

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,840
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,040
Won't you ring the alarm

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,340
I been through this too long

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,120
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,810
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,950
If I let you go

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,420
Get in the house off the coast

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,420
If I let you go

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,260
She gon' take everything I own

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,560
If I let you go

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,360
I can't let you go, damn if I let you go

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,870
She gon' rock them VVS stones

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,210
If I let you go

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,700
Get in the 'Bach or the Rolls

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,030
If I let you go

18
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,500
She gon' profit everything I taught

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,620
If I let you go

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,670
I can't let you go, damn if I let you go

21
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,150
Tell me how should I feel

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,480
When I know what I know

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,260
And my female intuition tellin me you a dog

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,790
People told me 'bout the flames

25
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,150
I couldn't see through the smoke

26
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,670
When I need answers, accusations

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,950
What you mean you gon choke

28
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,930
Oh

29
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,870
You can't stay, you gotta go

30
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,610
Ain't no other chick spendin' your dough

31
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,310
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds

32
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,170
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

33
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,590
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats

34
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,980
If I let you go

35
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,420
Get in the house off the coast

36
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,750
If I let you go

37
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,290
She gon' take everything I own

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,510
If I let you go

39
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,400
I can't let you go, damn if I let you go

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
She gon' rock them VVS stones

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,340
If I let you go

42
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,670
Get in the 'Bach or the Rolls

43
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,000
If I let you go

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,460
She gon' profit everything I taught

45
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,870
If I let you go

46
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,230
I can't let you go, damn if I let you go

47
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,060
Ring the alarm

48
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,360
I been through this too long

49
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,450
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

50
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,650
Won't you ring the alarm

51
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,040
I been through this too long

52
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,570
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

53
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,430
Tell me how should I feel

54
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,670
When you made me belong

55
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,370
And the thought of you just touchin' her

56
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,570
Is what I hate most

57
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,030
I don't want you, but I want it

58
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,320
And I can't let it go

59
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,670
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

60
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,260
Ooh

61
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,210
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)

62
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,980
But she gon' love that shit, I know

63
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,450
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm

64
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,510
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause...

65
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,840
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,170
If I let you go

67
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,750
Get in the house off the coast

And not see all the things

82
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,180

Why would you risk it babe

86
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,180
Is that the price that I pay

87
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,250
Ooh

But this is my show, and I won't let you go

All it's been paid for, and it's mine
