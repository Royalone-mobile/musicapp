1
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,500
Some people live for the fortune

2
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,710
Some people live just for the fame

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,980
Some people live for the power,yeah

4
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,900
Some people live to play the game

5
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,530
Some people think that the physical things

6
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,300
Define what's within

7
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,900
And I've been there before that life's a bore

8
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,040
So full of the superficial

9
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,620
Some people want it all

10
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,240
But I don't want nothing at all

11
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,430
If it ain't you baby

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,760
If I ain't got you baby

13
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,670
Some people want diamond rings

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,660
Some just want everything

15
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,750
But everything means nothing

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,180
If I ain't got you,yeah

17
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,920
Some people search for a fountain

18
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,280
That promises forever young

19
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:55,300
Some people need three dozen roses

20
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,150
And that's the only way to prove you love them

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,850
Hand me the world on a silver plater

22
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,150
And what good would it be

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,630
With no one to share

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,690
With no one who truly cares for me

25
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,440
Some people want it all

26
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,410
But I don't want nothing at all

27
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,420
If it ain't you baby

28
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,560
If I ain't got you baby

29
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,910
Some people want diamond rings

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,170
Some just want everything

31
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,580
But everything means nothing

32
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,150
If I ain't got you,you,you

33
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Some people want it all

34
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,980
But I don't want nothing at all

35
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,320
If it ain't you baby

36
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,890
If I ain't got you baby

37
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,980
Some people want diamond rings

38
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,280
Some just want everything

39
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,060
But everything means nothing

40
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:17,790
If I ain't got you,yeah

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,800
If I ain't got you with me baby

42
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:28,610
ohh,so nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing

43
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,780
If I ain't got you with me baby
