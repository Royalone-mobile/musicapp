00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,200
Ever wonder about what he's doing

3
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,860
How it all turned to lies

4
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,500
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,690
Where there is desire

6
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,580
There is gonna be a flame

7
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,680
Where there is a flame

8
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,170
Someone's bound to get burned

9
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,980
But just because it burns

10
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,650
Doesn't mean you're gonna die

11
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,270
You've gotta get up and try try try

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,800
Gotta get up and try try try

13
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,980
You gotta get up and try try try

14
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,370
Eh, eh, eh

15
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,220
Funny how the heart can be deceiving

16
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,820
More than just a couple times

17
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,610
Why do we fall in love so easy

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,850
Even when it's not right

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,100
Where there is desire

20
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,530
There is gonna be a flame

21
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,390
Where there is a flame

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,880
Someone's bound to get burned

23
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,000
But just because it burns

00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,550
Doesn't mean you're gonna die

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,190
Ever worried that it might be ruined

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,720
And does it make you wanna cry?

30
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,330
When you're out there doing what you're doing

31
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,680
Are you just getting by?

32
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,800
Tell me are you just getting by by by

33
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,460
Where there is desire

There is gonna be a flame
