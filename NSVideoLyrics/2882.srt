00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:29,458
on the carousel so around i spun (spun)

10
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:31,902
with no directions just tryna get some (some)

11
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:34,119
tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)

12
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:36,403

(that you wanna know)

20
