1
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,760
You know the bed feels warmer

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,360
Sleeping here alone

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,730
You know I dream in colour

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,290
And do the things I want

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,350
You think you got the best of me

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,460
Think you had the last laugh

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,650
Bet you think that everything good is gone

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,900
Think you left me broken down

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,840
Think that I'd come running back

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,260
Baby you don't know me, cause you're devil

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,810
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

12
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,870
Stand a little taller

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,360
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,790
What doesn't kill you makes a fire

15
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,040
Put that thing on ligher

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,790
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you'r gone

17
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,040
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,150
Just me, myself and I

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,450
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

20
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,760
Stand a little taller

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,260
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:25,430
You heard that I was starting over with someone new

23
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:33,600
But told you I was moving on over you

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,660
You didn't think that I'd come back

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,780
I'd come back swinging

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,380
You try to break me

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,630
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,740
Stand a little taller

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,420
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,860
What doesn't kill you makes a fire

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,050
Put that thing on lighter

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,540
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you'r gone

33
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,960
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,080
Just me, myself and I

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,530
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

36
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,520
Stand a little taller

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,380
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,430
Thanks to you I got a new thing started

39
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,430
Thanks to you I'm not a broken hearted

40
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,300
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking bout me

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,790
You know in the end the day to left was just my beginning

42
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,160
In the end...

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,650
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

44
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,830
Stand a little taller

45
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,140
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,950
What doesn't kill you makes a fire

47
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,130
Put that thing on lighter

48
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,750
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you'r gone

49
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,930
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

50
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,110
Just me, myself and I

51

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

52
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,730
Stand a little taller

53
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,340
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

54
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,500
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,560
Just me, myself and I
