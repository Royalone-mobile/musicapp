3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,340

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,910
Stop, I ain't ready yet

Been locked up in the house way too long,

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,790
It's time to get it,

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,960
Cause once again he's out doing wrong,

11

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,120
He's been acting up, but he won't be the only one

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,400
