1
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:11,596
Yeah

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,706
You are my fire

3
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:25,217
The one desire

4
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:30,583
Believe when I say

5
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:35,050
I want it that way

6
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:41,930
But we are two worlds apart

7
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:47,016
Can't reach to your heart

8
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:50,018
When you say

9
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:54,122
That I want it that way

10
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:55,751
Tell me why

11
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:59,121
Ain't nothin' but a heartache

12
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:00,583
Tell me why

13
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:04,235
Ain't nothin' but a mistake

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,423
Tell me why

15
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:09,578
I never wanna hear you say

16
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:14,259
I want it that way

17
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:18,603
Am I your fire

18
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:23,508
Your one desire

19
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:28,844
Yes I know it's too late

20
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,124
But I want it that way

21
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,536
Tell me why

22
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:37,999
Ain't nothin' but a heartache

23
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,273
Tell me why

24
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,719
Ain't nothin' but a mistake

25
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,168
Tell me why

26
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:48,339
I never wanna hear you say

27
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:53,307
I want it that way

28
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:57,909
Now I can see that we're falling apart

29
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:02,666
From the way that it used to be, yeah

30
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:04,800
No matter the distance

31
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:07,396
I want you to know

32
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:12,610
That deep down inside of me...

33
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:16,922
You are my fire

34
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:21,607
The one desire

35
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,845
You are

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,797
You are, you are, you are

37
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:32,126
Don't wanna hear you

38
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:36,874
Ain't nothin' but a heartache

39
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,578
Ain't nothin' but a mistake

40
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:42,411
(Don't wanna hear you say)

41
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:46,294
I never wanna hear you say

42
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,290
Oh Yeah

43
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:51,362
I want it that way

44
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,234
Tell me why

45
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,314
Ain't nothin' but a heartache

46
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,971
Tell me why

47
00:02:57,006 --> 00:03:00,421
Ain't nothin but a mistake

48
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:01,779
Tell me why

49
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:06,030
I never wanna hear you say

50
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:10,543
I want it that way

51
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:11,678
Tell me why

52
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:15,004
Ain't nothin' but a heartache

53
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,122
Ain't nothin' but a mistake

54
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,288
Tell me why

55
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:25,254
I never wanna hear you say

56
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,084
I want it that way

57
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:36,768
'Cause I want it that way
