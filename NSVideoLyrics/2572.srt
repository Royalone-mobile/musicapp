1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,010

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,250

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,630
come on, come on

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,690
a century I've been in solitude

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,570
trapped wanting to escape

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,310
dreaming that someone

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,270
releases me

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,640
you blow me a kiss

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,890
i want to love you

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,320
but there's a price

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,080
you'll have to pay

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,450
for me to give myself away

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,890
oh oh oh oh oh

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,770
my body says i want to

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,020
oh oh oh oh oh

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,820
but my soul is afraid

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,630
if you want me next to you

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,320
rub right and you will see

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,260

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,770
i will make your dreams reality

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,590

23

if you swear your love to me

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,020
like a trapped genie i wait

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,830
to be free with your sincere love

27

come, come, to remove me from here

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,400
dancing the passion dominates us

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,150
our impulses out of control

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,830
it's so difficult to contain ourselves

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,210
you think today it might happen

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,030
but i know that nothing will happen

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,270
