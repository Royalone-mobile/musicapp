1
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,550
I've seen love go by my door

2
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,550
It's never been this close before

3
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,860
Never been so easy or so slow

4
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,790
Been shooting in the dark too long

5
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,780
When something's not right it's wrong

6
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,900
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

7
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,460
Dragon clouds so high above

8
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,080
I've only known careless love,

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,200
It's always hit me from below.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,880
This time around it's more correct

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,560
Right on target, so direct,

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,800
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,040
     

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,600
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace,

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,220
Crimson hair across your face,

16
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,080
You could make me cry if you don't know.

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,770
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of

18
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,950
You might be spoilin' me too much, love,

19
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,190
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

20
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,310
Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy,

21
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,430
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme,

22
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,860
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy,

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,160
I could stay with you forever

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,030
And never realize the time.

25
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,900
Situations have ended sad,

26
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,150
Relationships have all been bad.

27
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,260
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud.

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,130
But there's no way I can compare

29
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,690
All those scenes to this affair,

30
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,120
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

31
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,240
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,670
Staying far behind without you.

33
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,910
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,

34
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:58,650
Make me give myself a good talking to.

35
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,710
I'll look for you in old Honolulu,

36
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,510
San Francisco and Ashtabula,

37
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,010
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know.

38
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,130
I'll see you in the sky above,

39
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,060
In the tall grass, in the ones I love,

40
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:28,970
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.

41
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:45,260
  

42
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:51,260
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
