1
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:14,592
I don't know what he does to make you cry

2
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:18,413
But I'll be there to make you smile

3
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:23,676
I don't have a fancy car

4
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:28,420
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles

5
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:34,502
I don't care if he buys you nice things

6
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:39,121
Does his gifts come from the heart?

7
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:41,307
I don't know

8
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,453
But if you were my girl

9
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:48,294
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

10
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,243
But my love is all I have to give

11
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:58,478
Without you I don't think I could live

12
00:00:58,513 --> 00:01:03,265
I wish I could give the world to you

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,247
But love is all I have to give

14
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:14,115
When you talk (when you talk) \Ndoes it seem like he's not

15
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,633
Even listening to a word you say?

16
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:23,479
That's okay babe, \njust tell me your problems

17
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:29,122
I'll try my best to kiss them all away

18
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:34,074
Does he leave (does he leave) \Nwhen you need him the most?

19
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,936
Does his friends get all your time?

20
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:41,066
Baby please

21
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,588
I'm on my knees

22
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:48,283
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

23
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:53,229
But my love is all I have to give

24
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:58,456
Without you I don't think I could live

25
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:03,386
I wish I could give the world to you

26
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:08,519
But love is all I have to give

27
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:19,138
To you... (hey girl) hey girl,\N I don't want you to cry no more inside

28
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:29,078
All the money in the world \Ncould never add up to all the love

29
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:31,281
I have inside... 

30
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:41,193
Without you I don't think I could live

31
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:45,984
I wish I could give the world to you

32
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,894
But love is all I have to give

33
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:55,956
But my love is all I have to give

34
00:02:55,991 --> 00:03:01,085
Without you I don't think I could live

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,890
I wish I could give the world to you

36
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:10,953
But love is all I have to give

37
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:21,042
But my love is all I have to give

38
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:27,433
Without you I don't think I can live

39
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:31,477
I wish I could give the world to you

40
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:37,978
But love is all I have to give... to you
