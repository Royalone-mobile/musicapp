1
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,850
Now, now, now, honey,

2
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,250
You better sit down and look around,

3
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,350
Cause you must've bumped yo' head.

4
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,050
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby,

5
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,150
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids,

6
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,950
And the dog is gone,

7
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,000
Check my credentials...

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,400
I give you everything you want, everything you need,

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,050
Even your friends say I'm a good woman.

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,800
All I need to know is why?

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,850
Why don't you love me? (Love me)

12
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,550
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me, (Love me)

13
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:12,220
When I make me so damn easy to love? (To love)

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,970
And why don't you need me? (Need me)

15
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,530
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me, (Why don't you need me)

16
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,370
When I make me so damn easy to need? (To need, To need)

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,620
I got beauty, I got class,

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,120
I got style, and I got ass,

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,470
And you don't even care to care.

20
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,640
Looka here...

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,140
I even put money in the bank account,

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,540
Don't have to ask no one to help me out,

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,440
You don't even notice that.

24
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,140
Why don't you love me? (Love me)

25
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,640
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me, (Love me)

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,290
When I make me so damn easy to love? (Easy, to love me, love me, love me)

27
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,590
Why don't you need me?

28
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,640
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me,

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,140
When I make me so damn easy to need?

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,940
I got beauty, I got heart,

31
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,340
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp,

32
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,240
But you don't care to know I'm smart.

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,290
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now...

34
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,040
I got moves in your bedroom,

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,440
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do,

36
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,240
But you don't seem to be in tune.

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Why don't you love me? (Love me)

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,690
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me, (Love me)

39
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:05,530
When I make me so damn easy to love? (Easy, to love me, lo-lo-love me, love me)

40
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,830
Why don't you need me?

41
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,880
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me,

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,330
When I make me so damn easy to need?

43
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,340
Why don't you love me? (Love me)

44
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,190
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me, (Love me)

45
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:49,030
When I make me so damn easy to love? (Easy, to love me, lo-lo-love me, love me)

46
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,830
Why don't you need me?

47
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,880
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me,

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,330
When I make me so damn easy to need?

49
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,030
(There's nothing not to love about me) There's nothing not to love about me,

50
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,530
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me. (Nothing not to love about me)

51
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,780
I'm lovely...

52
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,730
There's nothing not to need about me.

53
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,280
(There's nothing not to need about me)

54
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,580
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me.

55
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,980
(There's nothing not to need about me)

56
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,530
Maybe you're just not the one,

57
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,630
Or maybe you're just plain...

58
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,330
Dumb!
