1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,890
It's the most beautiful
time of the year

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,820
Lights fill the streets
spreading so much cheer

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,670
I should be
playing in the winter snow

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,540
But I'mma be
under the mistletoe

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,640
I don't wanna miss
her on the holiday

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,560
But I can't stop
staring at your face

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,520
I should be playing
in the winter snow

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,510
But I'mma be
under the mistletoe

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,130
With you,
shawty with you

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,150
With you,
under the mistletoe,

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,400
Everyone's gathering
around the fire

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,640
Chestnuts roasting
like a hot July

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,190
I should be chillin'
with my folks, I know

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,350
But I'mma be
under the mistletoe

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,290
Word on the streets
Santa's coming tonight

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,370
Reindeers flying
through the sky so high

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,450
I should be making a list,
I know

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,440
But I'mma be
under the mistletoe

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,280
With you,
shawty with you

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,770
With you,
under the mistletoe

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,700
With you,
shawty with you

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,140
With you,
under the mistletoe

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,760
Hey love,
the Wise Men followed a star

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,210
The way
I followed my heart

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,900
And it led me
to a miracle

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,720
Aye love,
don't you buy me nothing

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,050
'Cause I am
feeling one thing

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,660
Your lips
on my lips

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,390
That's a Merry
Merry Christmas

30
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,770
It's the most beautiful
time of the year

31
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,720
Lights fill the streets
spreading so much cheer

32
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,530
I should be playing
in the winter snow

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,550
But I'mma be
under the mistletoe

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,740
I don't wanna miss her
on the holiday

35
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,650
But I can't stop
staring at your face

36
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,370
I should be playing
in the winter snow

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,780
With you,
shawty with you

41
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,500
With you,
under the mistletoe

42
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,420
Kiss me
underneath the mistletoe

43
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,910
Show me baby
that you love me so

44
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,240
Kiss me
underneath the mistletoe
