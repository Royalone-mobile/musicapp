1
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,950
Summer after high school
when we first met

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,480
We make out in
your Mustang to Radiohead

3
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,840
And on my 18th Birthday
We got matching tattoos

4
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,270
Used to steal your parents' liquor
And climb to the roof

5
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,940
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,920
Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,150
In another life
I would be your girl

8
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:01,540
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world

9
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:08,460
In another life
I would make you stay

10
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,490
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away

11
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,830
The one that got away

12
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,680
I was June and you were
my Johnny Cash

13
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,670
Never one without the other
we made a pact

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,960
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on

15
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,400
Someone said you had
your tattoo removed

16
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,970
Saw you downtown
singing the Blues

17
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,870
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse

18
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:53,350
But in another life
I would be your girl

19
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:00,310
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world

20
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,630
In another life
I would make you stay

21
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,730
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away

22
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,950
The one that got away

23
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,680
The o-o-o-o-o-one

24
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,270
The o-o-o-o-o-one

25
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,150
The o-o-o-o-o-one

26
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,100
The one that got away

27
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:39,660
All this money can't buy me
a time machine (Nooooo)

28
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,950
Can't replace you with a
million rings (Nooooo)

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,890
I shoulda told you
what you meant to me (Wooow)

30
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,860
'Cause now I pay the price

31
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,050
In another life
I would be your girl

32
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,050
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world

33
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,140
In another life
I would make you stay

34
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:26,320
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away

35
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,460
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one

36
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,320
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The One..

37
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,650
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The One..

38
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:47,830
In another life
I would make you stay

39
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:55,100
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away

40
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,720
The one that got away
