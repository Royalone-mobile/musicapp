1
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,050
Moment of honesty

2
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,420
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight

3
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,600
Who's it gonna be?

4
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,910
I'm gonna sit right here

5
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,220
And tell u all that comes to me

6
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,090
And if you have something to say

7
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,080
You should say right now

8
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,020
You should say right now

9
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:20,810
You give me a feeling that I never felt before

10
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,430
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,920
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore

12
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,420
And I can't take it

13
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,540
I was wondering maybe

14
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,220
Could I make you my baby

15
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,090
If we do the Un-thinkable

16
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,590
Would it make us look crazy

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,520
If you ask me I'm ready

18
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,200
If you ask me I'm ready

19
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,940
I know you were sent to me

20
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,370
This is exactly how it should feel

21
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,560
When it's meant to be

22
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,870
Time is only wasting

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,110
So why wait for eventually

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,040
If we gonna do something about it

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,980
We should do right now

26
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,470
We should do right now

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,770
You give me a feeling that I never felt before

28
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,010
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:38,880
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore

30
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,440
It is what we make it

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,740
I was wondering maybe

32
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,240
Could I make you my baby

33
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,170
If we do the Un-thinkable

34
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,610
Would it make us look crazy

35
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,730
Or would it be so beautiful

36
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,290
Either way I'm saying

37
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,090
If you ask me I'm ready

38
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,460
If you ask me I'm ready

39
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,020
Yeah

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,580
Say

41
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,760
Why give up before we try

42
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,190
Feel the lows before the highs

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Clip our wings before we fly away

44
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,490
I can't say I came prepared

45
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,300
I'm suspended in the air

46
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,790
Won't you come be in the sky with me

47
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,470
I was wondering maybe

48
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,160
Could I make you my baby

49
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,090
If we do the Un-thinkable

50
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,580
Would it make us look crazy

51
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,770
Or would it be so beautiful

52
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,140
Either way I'm saying

53
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,070
If you ask me I'm ready

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,430
If you ask me I'm ready

55
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,240
If you ask me I'm ready

56
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,730
If you ask me I'm ready
