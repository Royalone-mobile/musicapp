1
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,290
Baby baby

2
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,450
When we first met I never felt something so strong

3
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,460
You were like my lover and my best friend

4
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,050
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it

5
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,570
And all of a sudden you went and left

6
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,560
I didn't know how to follow

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,580
It's like a shock that spun me around

8
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,970
And now my heart's dead

9
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,800
I feel so empty and hollow

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,310
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you

11
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,250
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?

12
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,250
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back

13
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,600
And you're the one to blame

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,180
And now I feel like....oh!

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,260
You're the reason why I'm thinking

16
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,110
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more

17
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,330
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,820
Should've never let you enter my door

19
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,010
Next time you wanna go on and leave

20
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,720
I should just let you go on and do it

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,380
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,370
It's like I checked into rehab

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,090
And baby, you're my disease

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,230
It's like I checked into rehab

25
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,480
And baby, you're my disease

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,080
I gotta check into rehab

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,800
'Cause baby you're my disease

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,040
I gotta check into rehab

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,040
'Cause baby you're my disease

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,130
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're loveswept (?)

31
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,920
You'd do anything for the one you love

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,120
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,740
It's like you were my favorite drug

34
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,850
The only problem is that you was using me

35
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,850
In a different way than I was using you

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,290
But now that I know it's not meant to be

37
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,190
I gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

38
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,150
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,560
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,030
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,160
And you're the one to blame

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,150

46

Now ladies gimme that...
