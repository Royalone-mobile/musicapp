00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,860
After all you put me through

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,250
You'd think I'd despise you

3
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,160

'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmm hmm

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,680
After all of the stealing and cheating

14

You probably think that i hold resentment for you

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,480
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

All of your backstabbing

31
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,400
Just so, you could cash in on a good thing

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,360
Before I'd realized your game

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,760
I heard you're going 'round

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,480
Playin' the victim now

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,970
But don't even begin feelin' I'm the one to blame

36
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,590
'Cause you dug your own grave

37

After all of the fights and the lies

38

But that won't work anymore

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,550
No more, uh uh, it's over

41
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,740
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture

42
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,370
I wouldn't know how to be this way now

43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,130

Turn out to be unjust so cruel?

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
Could only see the good in you

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,080
Pretended not to see the truth

58

You tried to hide your lies

59

Disguise yourself through

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,250
Living in denial

61
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,620
