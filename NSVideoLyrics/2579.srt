1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
I feel like I've been locked up tight

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
For a century of lonely nights

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,500
Waiting for someone to release me

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
You're licking your lips

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
And blowing kisses my way

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby)

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Ooooh

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
My body's saying lets go

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Ooooh

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
But my heart is saying no

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
If you wanna be with me

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Baby there's a price to pay

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
I'm a genie in a bottle

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
You gotta rub me the right way

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
If you wanna be with me

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
I can make your wish come true

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
You gotta make a big impression

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
I gotta like what you do

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm a genie in a bottle baby

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Gotta rub me the right way honey

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm a genie in a bottle baby

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Come, come, come on and let me out

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
The music's playing

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
The light's down low

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Just one more dance

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
And then we're good to go

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Waiting for someone

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Who needs me

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Hormones racing at the speed of light

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
But that don't mean its gotta be tonight

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Ooooh

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
My body's saying lets go

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Ooooh

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
But my heart is saying no

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
If you wanna be with me

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Baby there's a price to pay

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
You gotta rub me the right way

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
If you wanna be with me (Ooh)

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I can make your wish come true
(Wish come true, woah...)

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Just come and set me free

44
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,500
And I'll be with you

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
I'm a genie in a bottle baby

46
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
You gotta rub me the right way honey

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm a genie in a bottle baby

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Come, come, come on and let me out

Come, come, come on and let me out

53
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Ooooh

54
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
My body's saying let's go

55
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Ooooh

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
But my heart is saying no
