1
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,660
You could buy me diamonds

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,700
You could buy me pearls

3
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,800

Not just told but to show that you know she is worth your time

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,830
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,600
She will if she can't find a man who knows her worth, mhmn

And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,760
Don't take for granted the passion that she has for you

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:49,620
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
