1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,510
Yeah

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,010
Backin' that ass

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,490
Your mom says "Hi" — Jinx!

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,980
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

5
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,600
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

6
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,700
Summertime in the city

7
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,650
And everybody's having sex

8
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,600
You know I just got a page from a girl
that I met last week at the Pay-less

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,900
Shoe stores

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,770
I also have a cutie to call who loves
the way I knock on her boots

11
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,810
Well let's help them back

12
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,910
Let's handle that

13
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,250
In two-to-six hours,

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,020
We'll meet back here and regroup

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,850
Now let's shoop

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,310
Roll up to her crib with some Bartles & James

17
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,800
Hop off the bus with the Alizé

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,770
Now hold up player, whatchu diggity-doing here?

19
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,550
I should diggity-ask you the same

20
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,850
And she sang

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,330
Hey, boys I want you both

22
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,960
I hope that you think that's cool

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,000
(Say word?)

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,300
I know most guys won't freak together

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,860
She forgot about the golden rule — a huh huh

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,450
It's OK to put us in a three-way

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,380
It's not gay when it's in a three-way

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,010
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,210
The area's grey in a one, two, three-way

30
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,520
Normally, I don't get down with dudes

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,350
But tonight is a special exception (Great)

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,650
See you're my best friend

33
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,750
Through thick and thin

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,760
Now it's time to make a triple connection

35
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,090
Lights off

36
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,980
Here in the dark (Here in the dark)

37
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,650
It's so hard to tell (So hard to tell)

38
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,900
Where her body ends (La la)

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,610
And my homie's begins (Ew wee)

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,500
This rule dates back (The Golden Rule)

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,250
To ancient Greece (Takin' about Cesar)

42
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,300
We're two Jack Trippers and a Chrissy

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,470
The new Three's Company

44
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,070
You Guys Still Here ?

45
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,450
It's OK to put us in a three-way

46
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,380
It's not gay when it's in a three-way

47
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,010
With a honey in the middle there's some leeway

48
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,110
The area's grey in a one, two, three-way

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,160
Fellas. Get ready.

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,950
Doin' us a chick

51
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,140
Helicopter dick, go!

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,910
Helicopter dick

53
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,070
Doin' us a chick

54
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,370
Helicopter dick

55
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,620
Well

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
And all of that was OK

57
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,520
Cause it was in a three-way

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,200
It's quite clear when you see the instant replay (boom)

59
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,670
Maybe two is enough

60
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,970
That's what they'll say

61
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,330
But we'll say, "Hell no! "

62
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,080
One, two, three-way

63
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,750
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

64
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,520
The golden rule
