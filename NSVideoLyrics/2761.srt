12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,190
There's a stranger in my bed

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,130
There's a pounding in my head

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,990
Glitter all over the room

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,920
Pink flamingos in the pool

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,850
I smell like a minibar

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,710
DJ's passed out in the yard

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,330
Barbie's on the barbeque

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,780
There's a hickie or a bruise

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,520
Pictures of last night

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,220
Eended up online

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm screwed

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,690
Oh well

24
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,090
It's a black top blur

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,410
But I'm pretty sure it ruled

26
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,920
Last Friday night

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,510
Yeah we danced on tabletops

28
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,450
And we took too many shots

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,410
Think we kissed but I forgot

30
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,900
Last Friday night

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,300
Yeah we maxed our credit cards

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,850
And got kicked out of the bar

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,170
So we hit the boulevard

34
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,830
Last Friday night

35
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,640
We went streaking in the park

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,750
Skinny dipping in the dark

37
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,730
Then had a menage a trois

38
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,610
Last Friday night

39
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,280
Yeah I think we broke the law

40
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,480
Always say we're gonna stop-op

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,050
Whoa-oh-oah

42
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,130
This Friday night

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,570
Do it all again

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,380
This Friday night

45
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,450
Do it all again

46
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,270
Trying to connect the dots

47
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,090
Don't know what to tell my boss

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,050
Think the city towed my car

49
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,040
Chandelier is on the floor

50
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,050
With my favorite party dress

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,010
Warrants out for my arrest

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,740
Think I need a ginger ale

53
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,790
That was such an epic fail

54
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,660
Pictures of last night

55
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,420

Oh well

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,210
It's a blacked out blur

59
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,400
But I'm pretty sure it ruled

60
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,420
Damn

61
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,780

And got kicked out of the bars

00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,990
So we hit the boulevards

69
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,370
Last Friday night

70
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,220
