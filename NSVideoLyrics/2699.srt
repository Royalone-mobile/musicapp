1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,590
And I don't wanna see no more

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,880
Oh Oh (And I don't wanna see no more)

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,730
It was Saturday when I got that call

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,080
Far away from feeling tall

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,910
I know, I know, I know what the truth is

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,310
Yeah

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,530
I try to look away from what you did

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,590
Heartache became my friend

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,680
You walked away from me baby

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,480
I would've never done the same

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:54,270
You made me feel like our love was not real

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,100
You threw it all away, so

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,140
I don’t wanna wait for you

14
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,430
I don’t wanna wake up thinking, hoping

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,610
You will get it right this time

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,580
‘Cause you know that you’re so cold

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,310
I don’t wanna see no more

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,270
And I can’t get away from you

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,320
It’s one of the reasons why

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,410
That I just can’t get you out my mind

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,310
And all I keep seeing is your picture

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,800
I don’t wanna see no more

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,160
I don’t wanna see no more

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,020
I don’t wanna see no more

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,120
I don’t wanna see no more

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,740
I don’t wanna see no more

27
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,060
It was so easy to trust you baby

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,500
Guess I was so stupid baby

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,420
Oh, I didn’t ever think that this would come

30
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:56,980
You’re running right to another one, oh

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:04,850
You walked away from me baby

32
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,230
You threw it all away, so

33
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,090
I don’t wanna wait for you, no, no

34
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,420
I don’t wanna wake up thinking, hoping

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,790
You will get it right this time

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,610
‘Cause you know that you’re so cold

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,620
I don’t wanna see no more

38
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,360
And I can’t get away from you

39
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,310
It’s one of the reasons why

40
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,580
That I just can’t get you out my mind

41
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,400
And all I keep seeing is your picture

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,310
I don’t wanna see no more (no more)

43
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,450
I don’t wanna see no more (no more)

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,690
I don’t wanna see no more

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,300
I don’t wanna see no more

46
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,870
I don’t wanna see no more

47
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,510
I used to be afraid of letting go

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,870
The fragile part of me, I’m here right now

49
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,080
I need you to set me free

50
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,880
I can see it in your eyes

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,600
That you won’t blame it on me this time

52
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,370
No, never

53
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,810
You might want me back but I won’t look back, no

54
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,900
I don’t wanna wait for you

55
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,550
I don’t wanna wake up thinking, hoping

56
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,950
You will get it right this time

57
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,660
‘Cause you know that you’re so cold

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,810
I don’t wanna see no more

59
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,570
And I can’t get away from you

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,540
It’s one of the reasons why

61
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,690
That I just can’t get you out my mind

62
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,640
And all I keep seeing is your picture

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,500
I don't wanna see no more.

64
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,390
I don't wanna see no more.

65
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,450
I don't wanna see no more.

66
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,560
I don't wanna see no more.

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,390
I don't wanna see no more.
