1
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:09,103
Hmm, yeah, yeah

2
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:17,552
Baby, please try to forgive me

3
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:26,228
Stay here don't put out the glow

4
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:38,577
Hold me now don't bother \Nif every minute it makes me weaker

5
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:48,752
You can save me from the man \Nthat I've become, oh yeah

6
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:53,474
Lookin' back on the things I've done

7
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:58,486
I was tryin' to be someone

8
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:04,224
I played my part, kept you in the dark

9
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:12,067
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

10
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:22,209
Sadness is beautiful loneliness that's tragical

11
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:31,254
So help me I can't win this war, oh no

12
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:40,995
Touch me now don't bother \Nif every second it makes me weaker

13
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:50,981
You can save me from the man I've become

I'm here with my confession

19
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:21,831
Got nothing to hide no more

20
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:26,635
I don't know where to start

21
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:35,457
But to show you the shape of my heart

22
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:43,036
I'm lookin' back on things I've done

23
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:48,442
I never wanna play the same old part

24
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:52,508

25
