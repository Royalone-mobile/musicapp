1
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,720
Drew looks at me.

2
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,450
I fake a smile so he won't see.

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,480
I want and I needing

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,300
Everything that we should be

5
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,720
I bet she's beautiful.

6
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,110
That girl he talks about,

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,130
and she's got everything

8
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,130
that I have to live without

9
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,400
Drew talks to me

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,050
I laugh cause it's so damn funny

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,190
But I can't even see

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,220
Anyone when he's with me

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,520
He says he's so in love,

14
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,030
he's finally got it right.

15
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,050
I wonder if he knows

16
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,900
he's all I think about at night.

17
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,530
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.

18
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,190
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,750
He's the song in the car

20
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,280
I keep singing,

21
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,600
don't know why I do.

22
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,580
Drew walks by me.

23
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,020
Can he tell that I can't breathe?

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,140
And there he goes, so perfectly.

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,140
The kind of flawless I wish I could be.

26
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,560
She better hold him tight

27
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,130
Give him all her love,

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,420
look in those beautiful eyes

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,850
and know she's lucky cause..

30
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,520
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

31
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,140
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star

32
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,790
He's the song in the car

33
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,170
I keep singing,

34
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,380
Don't know why I do.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,830
So I drive home alone,

36
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,280
as I turn out the light,

37
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,340
I'll put his picture down

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,270
and maybe get some sleep tonight.

39
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,860
Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,780
The only one that's got enough of me to break my heart.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,110
He's the song in the car

42
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,390
I keep singing,

43
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,540
don't know why I do.

44
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,550
He's the time taken up,

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,990
but there's never enough.

46
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,410
And he's all that I need to fall into.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,370
Drew looks at me

48
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:29,390
I fake a smile so he won't see.
