1
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,110
He was a boy

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,720
She was a girl

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,710
Can I make it
anymore obvious?

4
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,390
He was a punk

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,040
She did ballet

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,910
What more can I say?

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,830
He wanted her

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,430
She'd never tell

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,610
Secretly she wanted
him as well

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,290
But all of her friends

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,850
Stuck up their nose

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,040
They had a problem
with his baggy clothes

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,780
He was
a skater boy

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,480
She said see
you later boy

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,520
He wasn't good
enough for her

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,160
She had
a pretty face

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,820
But her head
was up in space

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,310
She needed to come
back down to earth

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,730
Five years from now

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,280
She sits at home

21
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,670
Feeding the baby

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,250
She's all alone

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,870
She turns on tv

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,670
Guess who she sees?

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,710
Skater boy rockin' up MTV.

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,510
She calls up
her friends

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,090
They already know

28
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,040
And they've all got
tickets to see his show

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,790
She tags along

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,180
Stands in the crowd

31
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,850
Looks up at the man
that she turned down

32
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,980
He was
a skater boy

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,540
She said see
you later boy

34
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,700
He wasn't good
enough for her

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,270
Now he's a superstar

36
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,020
Slammin' on his guitar

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,150
Does your pretty face
see what he's worth?

38
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,700
He was
a skater boy

39
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,470
She said
see you later boy

40
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,460
He wasn't good
enough for her

41
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,100
Now he's a superstar

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,780
Slammin' on his guitar

43
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,390
Does your pretty face
see what he's worth?

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,230
Sorry girl
but you missed out

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,470
Well, tough luck,
that boy's mine now

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,640
We are more than
just good friends

47
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,730
This is how
the story ends

48
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,040
Too bad that
you couldn't see

49
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,330
See the man
that boy could be

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,420
There is more
than meets the eye

51
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,660
I see the soul that has in inside

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,090
He's just
a boy

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,730
And I'm just
a girl

54
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,740
Can I make it
anymore obvious?

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,430
We are in love

56
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,210
Haven't you heard

57
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,510
How we rock
each others world?

58
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,700
I'm with the
skater boy

59
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,320
I said see you
later boy

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,290
I'll be backstage
after the show

61
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,990
I'll be at
the studio

62
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,720
Singing the
song we wrote

63
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,700
About the girl
you used to know

64
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,460
I'm with the
skater boy

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,070
I said see you
later boy

66
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,160
I'll be backstage
after the show

67
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,860
I'll be at the studio

68
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,460
Singing the
song we wrote

69
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,090
About the girl
you used to know.
