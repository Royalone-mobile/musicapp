It's your night, ohhh

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,450
Wanna put my ear to your chest girl

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,640
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats

13

Snow falling on your hair, and I don't, I don't

Wanna get it off

23
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:07,540
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes

24
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,350
Wanna be your biggest gift
