1
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,520
A word is just a word

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,210
Till you mean what you say

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,400
And love isn't love

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Until you give it away

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,020
We got a gift

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,710
Yeah something to give

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,900
To make a change

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,460
Send it on

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,270
On and on

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,650
Just one can heal another

11
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,460
Be a part

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,270
Reach your heart

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,330
Just one spark starts a fire

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,960
With one little action

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,520
The chain reaction will never stop

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,400
Make it strong

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,770
Shine a light

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,840
And send it on

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,330
Just smile (Just smile)

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,020
And the world (And the world)

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,520
Will smile along with you

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,960
That small act of love

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,330
Is meant for one

24
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,090
Will become two

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,400
If we take the chances

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,460
To change the stances

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,210
Imagine what we can do

28
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:23,580
If we

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,020
Send it on

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,340
On and on

31
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,020
Just one can heal another

32
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,460
Be a part

33
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,340
Reach your heart

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,900
Just one spark starts a fire

35
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,400
With one little action

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,090
The chain reaction will never stop

37
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,780
Make it strong

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,270
Shine a light

39
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:54,400

There's power in love

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,340
And the choices we make

43
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,900
So starting now

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,030
There's not a moment to waste

45
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,020
A word is just a word

46
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,650
Till you mean what you say

47
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,090
And love isn't love

48
