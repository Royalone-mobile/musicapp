1
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,480
Tryin' to do my own thing, and I'm starting to figure it out

2
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,740
That it's alright keep it together where ever we go

3
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,130
And it's alright oh well whatever

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,610
Everybody needs to know

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,750
You might be crazy

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,330
Have I told you lately

7
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,770
That I love you

8
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,850
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,050
And it's crazy

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,720
That someone could change me

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,500
Now no matter what it is I have to do

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,440
I'm not afraid to try

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,490
And you need to know that you're the reason, why!

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,620
I don't even care when they say you're a little bit off

15
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,010
Look them in the eye I'd say I could never get enough

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,360
Cuz it's alright keep it together where ever we go

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,610
And it's alright oh well whatever

18
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,130
Everybody needs to know

19
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,020
You might be crazy

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,800
Have I told you lately

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,460
That I love you,

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,510
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly,

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,710
And it's crazy

24
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,270
That someone could change me

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,910
Now no matter what it is I have to do

26
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,410
I'm not afraid to try

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,610
And you need to know that you're the reason, why!

28
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,880
If it was rainin' you would yell at the sun

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,180
Pick up the pieces when the damage is done

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:06,240
You say it's just another day in the shade

31
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,650
Look at what a mess we made

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,970
You might be crazy

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,520
Have I told you lately

34
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,000
That I love you

35
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,270
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly

36
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,270
You might be crazy

37
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,940
Have I told you lately

38
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,190
That I love you

39
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,430
You're the only reason that I'm not afraid to fly

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,710
And it's crazy

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,430
That someone could change me

42
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,340
Now no matter what it is I have to do

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm not afraid to try

44
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:48,430
And you need to know that you're the reason, why!

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,220
I don't wanna make a scene. I don't wanna let you down
