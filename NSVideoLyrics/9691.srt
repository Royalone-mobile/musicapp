1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,460
I thought it would be easy,

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,870
but it ain’t for me

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,260
It’s kinda hard, when you lay

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,560
your heart on a one way street

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,060
I really thought by now

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,160
You would’ve slipped my mind

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,690
But the kind of love sent from

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,350
above is a killing kind

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,920
Put my mind to rest

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,840
and try to sleep it off

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,100
It will be alright when

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,550
the morning comes

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,910
Or ever run

14
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,140
Ain’t no doubt about it

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,340
I can’t live without it

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,390
Tried to forget you

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,070
But I can’t get you

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,280
outta my head

19
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,700
Just when I think you’re gone

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,650
You come back and turn it on

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,930
And just like a simple song

22
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,690
I can’t get you outta my head

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,090
Well I saw you dancing,

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,480
dancing in my dreams

25
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,850
I saw your face and

26
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,030
I cant erase all the things I see

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,700
Even if I try, Cause Lord knows I tried

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,400
I can’t escape and I can’t shake

29
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,580
the pain inside, oh

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,930
Crazy wind, She comes

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,700
so crazy as she goes

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,860
I’m holding out my hands

33
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,200
with nothing left to show

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,370
I guess its the way it goes

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,490
Ain’t no doubt about it

36
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,860
I can’t live without it

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,780
Tried to forget you

38
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,160
But I can’t get you

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,110
outta my head

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,010
Just when I think you’re gone

41
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,150
You come back and turn it on

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,390
And just like a simple song

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:11,170
I Can’t get you outta my head

44
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,380
Can’t get you outta my head

45
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,930
Can’t get you outta my head

46
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,360
Crazy wind, She comes

47
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,530
so crazy as she goes

48
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,920
I’m holding out my hands

49
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,220
with nothing left to show

50
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,660
Guess thats the way it goes

51
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,580
Can’t get you outta my head

53
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,070
Can’t get you, can’t get you, oh

54
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,420
Ain’t no doubt about it

55
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,811
I can’t live without it

56
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:50,459
Tried to forget you

57
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:51,491
But I can’t get you

58
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,339
outta my head

59
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,827
Just when I think you’re gone

60
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,100
You come back and turn it on

61
