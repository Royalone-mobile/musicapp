1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,300
No more champagne

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,510
And the fireworks are through

3
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,440
Here we are, me and you

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,890
Feeling lost and feeling blue

5
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,440
It's the end of the party

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,920
And the morning seems so grey

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,060
So unlike yesterday

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:47,150
Now's the time for us to say...

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,610
Happy new year

10
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,080
May we all have a vision now and then

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,250
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend

12
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,890
Happy new year

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,340
May we all have our hopes, our will to try

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:20,750
If we don't we might as well lay down and die

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,100
You and I

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,170
Sometimes I see

17
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,430
How the brave new world arrives

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,270
And I see how it thrives

19
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,980
In the ashes of our lives

20
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,410
Oh yes, man is a fool

21
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,830
And he thinks he'll be okay

22
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,630
Dragging on, feet of clay

23
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,450
Never knowing he's astray

24
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:59,420
Keeps on going anyway...

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,170
Happy new year

26
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,430
May we all have a vision now and then

27
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:15,720
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,270
Happy new year

29
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,760
May we all have our hopes, our will to try

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,920
If we don't we might as well lay down and die

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:51,000
You and I

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,950
Seems to me now

33
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,530
That the dreams we had before

34
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,350
Are all dead, nothing more

35
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,550
Than confetti on the floor

36
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,470
It's the end of a decade

37
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,950
In another ten years time

38
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,940
Who can say what we'll find

39
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,390
What lies waiting down the line

40
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:26,300
In the end of eighty-nine...

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,920
Happy new year

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,310
May we all have a vision now and then

43
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,730
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend

44
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,230
Happy new year

45
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,770
May we all have our hopes, our will to try

46
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:59,860
If we don't we might as well lay down and die

47
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:09,860
You and I
