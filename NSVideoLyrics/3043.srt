00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,300
Every night I rush to my bed

3
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,360
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,260
When i close my eyes

5

I'm going out of my head

6
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,560
Lost in a fairytale

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Can you hold my hands and be my guide

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,250
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies

9
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,590
And I hope it rains

10
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,310
You're the perfect lullaby

11
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,360
What kinda dream am is this?

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,310
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

13

Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you (Turn The Lights On)

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn The Lights On)

16

My guilty pleasure I ain't going no where

17
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,110

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,870
I wrap you around around all of my thoughts

23
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,230
Boy you're my temporary high

24

I wish that when I wake up you're there

00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,820
To wrap your arms around me for real

26
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,880
And tell me you'll stay by side
