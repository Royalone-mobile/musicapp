1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,690
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the museum

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,910
Tonight we are proud to unveil our greatest exhibit yet

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,890
A creature so rare it was believed to be extinct

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,630
Well tonight we shall see

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,800
Ladies and gentlemen, in captivity for the first time
the rarest creature on earth: Aves-Cyrus.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:01:05,200
    

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,120
For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy


8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,870
Have to get my way, 24 hours a day

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,380
'Cause I'm hot like that

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,280
Every guy everywhere just gives me mad attention

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,020
Like I'm under inspection, I always get the 10s

12
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,780
'Cause I'm built like that

13
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,920
I go through guys like money flyin' out their hands

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,710
They try to change me but they realize they can't

15
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,790
And every tomorrow is a day I never planned

16
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,000
If you're gonna be my man, understand

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,020
I can't be tamed, I can't be saved

18
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,200
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,020
I can't be tamed, I can't be changed

20
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,000
I can't be saved, I can't be

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,880
I can't be tamed

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,270
If I see my reflectiona bout my intentions

23
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,520
I'll tell ya I'm not here to sell ya

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,000
Or tell ya to get to hell

25
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,850
I'm like a puzzle but all of my pieces are jagged

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,740
If you can understand this, we can make some magic

27
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,010
I'm on like that

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,400
I wanna fly I wanna drive I wanna go

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,010
I wanna be a part of something I don't know

30
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,020
And if you try to hold me back I might explode

31
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,020
Baby by now you should know

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,000
I can't be tamed, I can't be saved

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,550
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't

34
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,430
I can't be tamed, I can't be changed

35
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,330
I can't be saved, I can't be

36
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,020
I can't be tamed

37
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,360
I'm not a trick you play, I ride a different way

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,430
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, It's set in my DNA

39
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,020
Don't change me

40
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't change me

41
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,360
Don't change me

42
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,120
Don't change me

43
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,370
I wanna fly I wanna drive I wanna go

44
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,360
I wanna be a part of something I don’t know

45
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,470
And if you try to hold me back I might explode

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,920
Baby by now you should know

47
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,690
I can't be tamed, I can't be saved

48
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,560
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,780
I can't be tamed, I can't be changed

50
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,130
I can't be saved, I can't be
