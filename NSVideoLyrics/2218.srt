Ladies and gentlemen

00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,150
It's my pleasure to introduce to you

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,100
He's a friend of mine

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,880
Yes, yes I am

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,110
And he goes by the name...

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,150
Justin

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,830

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,310
All the way

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,090
from Memphis, Tennessee

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,380
And he's got somethin' special
for y'all tonight

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,630
He's gonna sing a song for y'all

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,160
About this girl

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,400
Come in right here?

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,780
Yea, come on

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,180
On that sunny day

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,330
Didn't know I'd meet

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,040
Such a beautiful girl

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,370
Walking down the street

19
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,940
Seen those bright brown eyes

20
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,530
With tears coming down

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,730
She deserves a crown

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,720
But where is it now

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,940
Mamma listen

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,620
Senorita, I feel for you

25
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,600
You deal with things, that you don't have to

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,330
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,870
But you could feel this real love

28
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,790
If you just lay in my...

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,450
Running fast in my mind

30
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,100
Girl don't you slow it down

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,570
If we carry on this way

32
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,720
This thing might leave the ground

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,260
How would you like to fly?

34
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,480
That's how my queen should arrive

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,490
But you still deserve the crown

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,720
or hasn't it been found?

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,990
Mamma listen

38
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,400
Senorita, I feel for you

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,380
(Feel for you)

40
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,830
You deal with things, that you don't have to

41
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,490
(No, no)

42
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,050
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm

43
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,180
(He don't love ya baby)

44
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,470
But you could feel this real love

45
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,280
(Feel it)

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,060
If you just lay in my...

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,960
Ah, ah, arms...

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,890
(Won't you lay in my)

49
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,850
Ah, ah, arms...

50
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,880
(Mama lay in my)

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,440
Ah, ah, arms...

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,530
(Baby won't you lay in my)

53
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,080
Ah, ah, arms...

54
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,500
When I look into your eyes

55
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,310
I see something that money can't buy

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,330
And I know if you give us a try

57
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,190
I'll work hard for you girl

58
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,100
And no longer will you ever have to cry

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,100
Senorita, I feel for you

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,940
You deal with things, that you don't have to

61
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,250
(Deal with things you don't have to)

62
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,190
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm

63
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,640
(No, no)

64
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,060
But you could feel this real love

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,890
(Feel it)

66
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,410
If you just lay in my...

67
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,840
Ah, ah, arms...

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,660
Ah, ah, arms...

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,130
Ah, ah, arms...

72
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,920

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,370
Ah, ah, arms...

74
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,540

I wanna try somethin' right now

76
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,990
