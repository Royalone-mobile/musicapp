1
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,150
I traveled a long long way

2
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,060
Looking for something unknown

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,580
Now you're standing right there
 through your smile I've found my way back home

4
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,010
Right in your arms

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,060
I feel strong

6
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,710
I feel free and I feel inspired

7
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,600
No matter how the world is turning

8
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,510
I know with you I know I will be fine

9
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,300

Another summer passes

27
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,670
Winter's here and nothing's changed
