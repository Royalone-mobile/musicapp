1
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:19,017
Lucky you were born that far away so

2
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,099
We could both make fun of distance

3
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:23,397
Lucky that I love a foreign land for

4
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:25,516
The lucky fact of your existence

5
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,887
Baby I would climb the Andes solely

6
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:30,000
To count the freckles on your body

7
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:32,232
Never could imagine there were only

8
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:34,393
Ten Million ways to love somebody

9
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:38,758
Le ro lo le lo le, Le ro lo le lo le

10
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,870
Can't you see

11
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:43,272
I'm at your feet

12
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:45,717
Whenever, wherever

13
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:47,666
We're meant to be together

14
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,172
I'll be there and you'll be near

15
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:52,340
And that's the deal my dear

16
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,518
Thereover, hereunder

17
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:56,492
You'll never have to wonder

18
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:58,969
We can always play by ear

19
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,252
But that's the deal my dear

20
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,581
Lucky that my lips not only mumble

21
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,746
They spill kisses like a fountain

22
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:19,043
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble

23
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,327
So you don't confuse them with mountains

24
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,572
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother

25
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,732
To run for cover when I need it

26
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,018
And these two eyes that for no other

27
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:30,122
The day you leave will cry a river

28
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:34,468
Le ro le le lo le, Le ro le le lo le

29
00:01:34,503 --> 00:01:36,658
At your feet

30
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:39,140
I'm at your feet

31
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:41,373
Whenever, wherever

32
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:43,326
We're meant to be together

33
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:45,925
I'll be there and you'll be near

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,094
And that's the deal my dear

35
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:50,321
Thereover, hereunder

36
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:52,406
You'll never have to wonder

37
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,782
We can always play by ear

38
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:56,936
But that's the deal my dear

39
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:10,086
Le ro le le lo le, Le ro le le lo le

40
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,271
Think out loud

41
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,619
Say it again

42
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,824
Le ro lo le lo le lo le

43
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:18,978
Tell me one more time

44
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,053
That you'll live

45
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:23,980
Lost in my eyes

46
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:28,113
Whenever, wherever

47
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,185
We're meant to be together

48
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,743
I'll be there and you'll be near

49
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,764
And that's the deal my dear

50
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,891
Thereover, hereunder

51
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:39,412
You've got me head over heels

52
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:41,518
There's nothing left to fear

53
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,837
If you really feel the way I feel

54
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,230
Whenever, wherever

55
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,084
We're meant to be together

56
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:50,492
I'll be there and you'll be near

57
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,605
And that's the deal my dear

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,973
Thereover, hereunder

59
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,291
You've got me head over heels

60
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:59,543
There's nothing left to fear

61
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:02,309
If you really feel the way I feel
