1
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,580
You were my sun

2
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,780
You were my earth

3
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:39,380
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,440
So you took a chance

5
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,870
And made other plans

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,430
But I bet you didn't think that

7
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,880
they would come crashing down, no

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,720
You don't have to say, what you did,

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,060
I already know, I found out from him

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,060
Now there's just no chance, for you and me,

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,850
there'll never be

12
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,660
And don't it make you sad about it

13
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,070
You told me you loved me

14
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,110
Why did you leave me, all alone

15
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,700
Now you tell me you need me

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,840
When you call me, on the phone

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,690
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused

18
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,530
With some other guy

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,270
Your bridges were burned,

20
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,560
and now it's your turn

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,840
To cry, cry me a river

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,380
Cry me a river-er

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,540
Cry me a river

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,220
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,870
I know that they say

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,390
That somethings are better left unsaid

27
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,400
It wasn't like you only talked

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,730
to him and you know it

29
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,490
(Don't act like you don't know it)

30
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,650
All of these things people told me

31
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,700
Keep messing with my head

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,390
(Messing with my head)

33
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,180
You should've picked honesty

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,810
Then you may not have blown it

35
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,240
(Yea..)

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,530
You don't have to say, what you did,

37
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,860
(Don't have to say, what you did)

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,390
I already know, I found out from him

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,020
(I already know, uh)

40
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,830
Now there's just no chance, for you and me,
there'll never be

41
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,850
(No chance, you and me)

42
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,690
And don't it make you sad about it

43
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,960
You told me you loved me

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,640
Why did you leave me, all alone

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,540
(All alone)

46
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,520
Now you tell me you need me

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,140
When you call me, on the phone

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,740
(When you call me on the phone)

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,410
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused

50
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,050
With some other guy

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,670
(I'm not like them baby)

52
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,840
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,550
(It's your turn)

54
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,490
To cry, cry me a river

55
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,010
(Go on and just)

56
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,350
Cry me a river-er

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,060
(Go on and just)

58
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,780
Cry me a river

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,250
(Baby go on and just)

60
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,330
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

61
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,520
Oh

62
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,370
(Oh)

63
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,660
The damage is done

64
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,730
So I guess I be leaving

65
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,940
Oh

66
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,380
(Oh)

67
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,160
The damage is done

68
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,110
So I guess I be leaving

69
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,380
Oh

70
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,750
(Oh)

71
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,120
The damage is done

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,700
So I guess I be leaving

73
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,260
Oh

74
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,330
(Oh)

75
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,020
The damage is done

76
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,850
So I guess I be... leaving

77
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,010
You don't have to say, what you did,

78
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,010
(Don't have to say, what you did)

79
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,620
I already know, I found out from him

80
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,890
(I already know, uh)

81
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,100
Now there's just no chance, for you and me,
there'll never be

82
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,630
(No chance, you and me)

83
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,220
And don't it make you sad about it

84
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,080
Cry me a river

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,700
(Go on and just)

86
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,620
Cry me a river-er

87
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,500
(Baby go on and just)

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,730
Cry me a river

89
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,300
(You can go on and just)

90
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,690
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

91

(Baby go on and just)

93
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,950
Cry me a river-er

94
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,110
(Go on and just)

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,870
Cry me a river

96
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,200
(Cause I've already cried)

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,260
Cry me a river-er, yea yea

98
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,960
