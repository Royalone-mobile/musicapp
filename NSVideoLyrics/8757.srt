1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Every time you feel like you cannot go on

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You feel so lost and that you're so alone 

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All you see is night, and darkness all around

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You feel so helpless you can't see which way to go 

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't despair, and never lose hope

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
â€˜Cause Allah is always by your side 

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Insha Allah (God-willing), insha Allah, insha Allah

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You'll find your way 

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Insha Allah, insha Allah, insha Allah

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You'll find your way

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Every time, you commit one more mistake

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You feel you can't repent and that it's way too late

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're so confused 

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Wrong decisions you have made

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Haunt your mind and your heart is full shame

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But don't despair

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And never lose hope

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
'Cause Allah is always by your side

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You'll find your way

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Turn to Allah, He's never far away

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Put your trust in Him

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Raise your hands and pray

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Ooh ya Allah!

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Guide my steps, don't let me go astray

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're the only one who can show me the way

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Show me the way, show me the way, show me the way

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Insha Allah, insha Allah, insha Allah
