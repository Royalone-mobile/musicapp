1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,410
I got my sight set on you

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,620
And I'm ready to wait

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,750
I have a heart that will

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,370
Never be tamed

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,560
I knew you were something special

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,870
When you spoke my name

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,250
Now I can't wait

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,190
To see you again

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,250
I've got a way of knowing

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,940
When something is right

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,370
I feel like I must have known you

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,060
In another life

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,500
'Cause I felt this deep connection

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,810
When you looked in my eyes

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,560
(I can't wait)

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,940
Now I can't wait

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,940
To see you again

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,690
The last time I freaked out

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,120
I just kept looking down

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,500
I st-st-stuttered

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,440
When you asked me

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,620
What I'm thinkin' 'bout

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,560
Felt like I couldn't breathe

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,000
You asked what's wrong with me

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,690
My best friend Leslie said

26
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,560
"Oh she's just being Miley"

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,370
The next time we hang out

28
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,940
I will redeem myself

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,250
My heart it can't rest till then

30
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,750
Woh oh I,

31
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,560
I can't wait

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,440
To see you again

33
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,690
I got this crazy feeling

34
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,190
Deep inside

35
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,750
When you called

36
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,500
And asked to see me

37
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,370
Tomorrow night

38
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm not a mind reader

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,120
But I'm reading the signs

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,870
(That you can't wait)

41
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,250
That you can't wait

42
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,940
To see me again

43
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,870
The last time I freaked out

44
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,440
I just kept looking down

45
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,750
I st-st-stuttered

46
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,620
When you asked me

47
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,940
What I'm thinkin' 'bout

48
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,690
Felt like I couldn't breathe

49
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,370
You asked what's wrong with me

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,940
My best friend Leslie said

51
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,810

00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,560
The next time we hang out

53
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,250
I will redeem myself

54
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,560
My heart can't rest till then

55
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,310
Wohoh oh I,

56
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,690
I can't wait to see you again

57
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,940
I got my sight set on you

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,310
And I'm ready to wait

59
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,810
The last time I freaked out

60
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,440

Felt like I couldn't breathe

65
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,310
You asked what's wrong with me

66
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,000
My best friend Leslie said

Woh oh I,

72
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,250
I can't wait to see you again

73
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,620
(To see you again)

74
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,120
Woh oh I,

75
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,750
I can't wait

76
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:09,070
To see you again
