1
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,980
Look at me

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,400
You may think you see who I really am

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,840
But you'll never know me

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,090
Ev'ry day

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,450
It's as if I play a part

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,490
Now I see

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,820
If I wear a mask

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,880
I can fool the world

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,380
But I cannot fool my heart

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,850
Who is that girl I see

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,390
Staring straight back at me?

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,860
When will my reflection show

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,780
Who I am inside?

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,020
I am now

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,270
In a world where I

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,350
Have to hide my heart

17
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,850
And what I believe in

18
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,060
But somehow

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,520
I will show the world

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,360
What's inside my heart

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,110
And be loved for who I am

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,200
Who is that girl I see

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,930
Staring straight back at me?

24
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,020
Why is my reflection

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,790
Someone I don't know?

26
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:57,340
Must I pretend that I'm

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,870
Someone else for all time?

28
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:07,170
When will my reflection show

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,140
Who I am inside?

30
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:19,070
There's a heart that must be free to fly

31
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:29,480
That burns with a need to know the reason why

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,750
Why must we all conceal

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,980
What we think

34
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,480
How we feel?

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,190
Must there be a secret me

36
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm forced to hide?

37
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,800
I won't pretend that I'm

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,570
Someone else for all time

39
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,880
When will my reflection show

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,590
Who I am inside?

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,940
When will my reflection show

42
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,880
Who I am inside?
