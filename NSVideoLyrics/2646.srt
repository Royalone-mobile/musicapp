1
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:21,922
Who are you now?

2
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:24,890
Are you still the same

3
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:28,330
Or did you change somehow?

4
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,176
What do you do

5
00:00:31,211 --> 00:00:37,760
At this very moment when I think of you?

6
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:43,068
And when I'm looking back

7
00:00:43,103 --> 00:00:46,604
How we were young and stupid

8
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:52,725
Do you remember that?

9
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,777
No matter how I fight it

10
00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:59,837
Can't deny it

11
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:03,713
Just can't let you go

12
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:08,162
I still need you

13
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:13,920
I still care about you

14
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:22,145
Though everything's been said and done

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,652
I still feel you

16
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:32,232
Like I'm right beside you

17
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:39,010
But still no word from you

18
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:46,157
Now look at me

19
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:52,046
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see

20
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:57,613
That I keep coming back

21
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:01,598
And I'm stuck in a moment

22
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:08,823
That wasn't meant to last (to last)

23
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:12,173
I've tried to fight it

24
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,205
Can't deny it

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,958
You don't even know

26
00:02:17,993 --> 00:02:22,722
That I still need you

27
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:28,424
I still care about you

28
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:36,665
Though everything's been said and done

29
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,205
I still feel you

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,848
Like I'm right beside you

31
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:53,856
But still no word from you

32
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:56,818
No no

33
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,144
Wish I could find you

34
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,307
Just like you found me

35
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:14,629
Then I would never let you go (without you)

36
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:23,275
Though everything's been \Nsaid and done (yeah)

37
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,308
I still feel you (I still feel you)

38
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:33,863
Like I'm right beside you \N(like I'm right beside you)

39
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:40,987
But still no (still no word) word from you
