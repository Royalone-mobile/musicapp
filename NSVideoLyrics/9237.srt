1
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,320
You got a girl

2
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,740
That doesn’t look a thing like me

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,520
The girl, your mother always said it would be

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,440
So, you could say that, you could say that

5
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,590
I’m hopeless

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,910
But that ain’t the girl

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,100
That ain’t the girl I want you to be

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,320
The girl that keeps up

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,030
And I see in my dreams

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,910
So, you could say that, you could say that

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,660
I love her

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,620
So I don’t care what they say

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,520
It’s our life life life

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,670
We can dance if we want

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,420
Make it feel alright

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,600
Temperature’s rising

17
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,370
I feel the fire

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,770
Tonight, it’s just me and you

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,450
Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,190
Even with no make up

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,470
I don’t want to fake it

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,910
And you don’t gotta doubt a second if I miss you

23
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,820
Everytime I’m with you

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,240
I feel naked

25
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:32,190
Hey! I feel naked, I want it 
 so let me get it, you say you got it, won’t you come to get it

26
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,730
If I told you girl

27
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,300
Come and run away with me

28
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,630
Now will you throw it all away for me

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,140
I need to know that, need to know that

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,500
It’s not over

31
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,270
Cause you were the boy

32
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,950
Daddy told you to stay away from me

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,520
But you’re nothing but a fantasy

34
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,570
I need to know that, need to know that

35
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,550
You’d be strong enough to believe in us

36
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,370
Cause I don’t care what they say

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,150
It’s our life life life

38
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,050
We can dance if we want

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,190
Make it feel alright

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,420
Temperature’s rising

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
I feel the fire

42
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,990
Tonight, it’s just me and you

43
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,850
Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up

44
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,880
I feel naked

45
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:44,960
Hey! I feel naked, I want it 
 so let me get it, you say you got it, it’s The Cataracs

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:03:01,100
I feel naked, I want it, so let me get it
 you say you got it, won’t you come to get it
