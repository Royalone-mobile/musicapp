1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,950
Give me time to reason,

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,950
give me time to think it through

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,950
Passing through the season,

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,950
where I cheated you

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,950
I will always have a cross to wear,

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,950
but the bolt reminds me I was there

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,950
So give me strength,

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,950
to face this test tonight

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,950
If only I could turn back time,

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,950
If only I had said what I still hide

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,950
If only I could turn back time,

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,950
I would stay for the night... for the night

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,950
Claim your right to science,

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,950
Claim your right to see the truth

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,950
Though my pangs of conscience,

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,950
Will drill a hole in you

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,950
I've seen it coming like a thief in the night,

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,950
I've seen it coming from the flesh of your light

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,950
So give me strength,

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,950
to face this test tonight

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,950
If only I could turn back time,

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,950
if only I had said what I still hide

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,950
if only I could turn back time,

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,950
I would stay.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,950
The bolt reminds me I was there

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,950
the bolt reminds me I was there

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,950
If only I could turn back time,

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,950
If only I had said what I still hide

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,950
If only I could turn back time,

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,950
I would stay for the night... for the night

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,950
If only I could turn back time,

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,950
If only I had said what I still hide

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,950
If only I could turn back time,

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,950
I would stay for the night.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,950
If only I could

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,950
If only I could

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,950
If only I could turn back time,

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,950
I would stay for the night.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,950
If only I could

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,950
If only I could

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,950
If only I could turn back time,

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,950
I would stay for the night.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,950
If only I could

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If only I could
