1
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,430
I have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride

2
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:45,780
Commit or not commit is such a crazy time

3
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,620
It's sooner than I thought but you called me out

4
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,980
I lost control and there's no doubt

5
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,540
I'm gonna start all over

6
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,770
Out of the fire and into the fire again

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,190
You make me want to forget

8
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:05,870
And

9
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,170
Start all over

10
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,280
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,580
Another chance to get burned

12
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,330
And

13
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,320
Start all over

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:27,270
I'm gonna start all over

15
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,890
Fantastic and romantic

16
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,740
All a big surprise

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:40,030
You've got the warning hazard station pushed aside

18
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,330
It's sooner than I want

19
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,190
But you caught my heart

20
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,100
I guess I'm ready now to start

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm gonna start all over

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,890
Out of the fire and into the fire again

23
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,260
You make me want to forget

24
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,010
And

25
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,180
Start all over

26
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,420
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,670
Another chance to get burned

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,470
And

29
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,460
Start all over

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,920
I'm gonna start all over

31
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,480
It's so easy

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,090
You disrupt me

33
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,210
Can't complain

34
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,760
It's so easy

35
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,380
You disrupt me

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,610
Can't complain

37
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,230
It's so easy

38
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,920
You disrupt me

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,710
Can't complain

40
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,820
It's so easy...

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,740
I'm gonna start all over

42
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,040
Start all over

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,150
Out of the fire and into the fire again

44
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,450
You make me want to forget

45
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,130
And

46
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,520
Start all over

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,570
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse

48
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,990
Another chance to get burned

49
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,870
And

50
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,170
Start all over

51
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,410
Out of the fire and into the fire again

52
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,640
You make me want to forget

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,390
And

54
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,620
Start all over

55
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,860
Here I come straight out of my mind or worse

56
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,350
Another chance to get burned

57
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,030
And

58
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,830
Start all over

59
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,830
I'm gonna start all over
