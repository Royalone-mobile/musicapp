1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,970
Life's like this

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,770
That's the way it is

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,310
Cause life's like this

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,060
That's the way it is

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,950
Chill out
whatcha yelling' for?

6
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,070
Lay back it's all
been done before

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,110
And if you could only let it be
you will see

8
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,200
I like you the
way you are

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,380
When we're
drivin' in your car

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,410
And you're talking
to me one on one

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,650
But you've become
Somebody else

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,120
Round everyone else

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,250
You're watching your back
like you can't relax

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,180
You're tryin' to be cool
you look like a fool to me

15
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,430
Tell me

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,590
Why you have to go and
make things so complicated?

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,770
I see the way you're

18
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,800
Acting like you're somebody else
gets me frustrated

19
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,050
Life's like this
you...

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,530
And you fall and
you crawl and you break

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,020
And you take what you get
and you turn it into

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,520
Honesty
and promise me

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,240
I'm never gonna
find you fake it

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,230
No,
no, no

25
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,590
You come over
unannounced

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,700
Dressed up like
you're somethin' else

27
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,720
Where you are and
where it's at you see

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,740
You're making me

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,910
Laugh out when you
strike your pose

30
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,970
Take off all your
preppy clothes

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,100
You know you're not
fooling anyone

32
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,260
when you've become
Somebody else

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,780
Round everyone else

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,840
Watching your back,
like you can't relax

35
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,830
Trying to be cool you look
like a fool to me

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,290
Tell me

37
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,200
Why you have to go and
make things so complicated?

38
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,310

Chill out whatcha
