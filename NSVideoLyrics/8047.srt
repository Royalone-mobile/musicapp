1
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,360
When I look into your eyes

2
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,670
It's like watching the night sky

3
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,890
Or a beautiful sunrise

4
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,210
There's so much they hold

5
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,580
And just like them old stars

6
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,220
I see that you've come so far

7
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,090
To be right where you are

8
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,520
How old is your soul?

9
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,890
I won't give up on us

10
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,940
Even if the skies get rough

11
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,290
I'm giving you all my love

12
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,300
I'm still looking up

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,840
And when you're needing your space

14
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,800
To do some navigating

15
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,360
I'll be here patiently waiting

16
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,430
To see what you find

17
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,890
'Cause even the stars they burn

18
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,210
Some even fall to the earth

19
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,600
We've got a lot to learn

20
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,320
God knows we're worth it

21
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,060
No, I won't give up

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,670
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily

23
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make

24
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,090
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use

25
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,160
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake

26
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,170
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend

27
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,800
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,180
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in

29
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,220
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not

30
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,370
And who I am

31
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,210
I won't give up on us

32
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,290
Even if the skies get rough

33
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,520
I'm giving you all my love

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,210
I'm still looking up

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,730
Still looking up.

36
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,930
I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)

37
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,300
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,850
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)

39
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,680
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

40
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,950
I won't give up on us

41
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,220
Even if the skies get rough

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,420
I'm giving you all my love

43
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,320
I'm still looking up
