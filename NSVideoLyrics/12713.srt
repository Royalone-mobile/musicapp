1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,830
You caught me off guard, you know

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,350
Hey I'm wasting my judge

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,260
Don't know if you can hold me but,

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,010
I gotta honor it yeah

5
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,800
Depending on the minute and depending on the hours

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,360
I guess I got some time to waste so

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,650
We can chop away the hours, yeah

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,610
Cool so let's sing, and then let's walk

00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,520
And then let's talk, and, and then, and then

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,990
Let's sing, and then less walking, and less talking

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,870
And we'll sing, yeah

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,530
Bring your car in the parking lot

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,750
And ride all night till you get a spot

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,670
Cause we ain't doing nothing

15

Depending on the chemicals yeah we can make some power

31
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,670
Cool so let's sing, and then let's walk

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,820
You're just a regular guy, and there's no way around it
