1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,930
You're insecure

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,930
Don't know what for

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,050
You're turning heads

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,670
When you walk through the do o or

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,720
Don't need make up to cover up

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,390
Being the way that you are is e eno ough

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,890
Everyone else in the room can see it

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,940
Everyone else but you

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,130
Baby you light up my world

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,750
Like nobody else

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,940
The way that you flip your hair

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,620
Gets me overwhelmed

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,810
But when you smile at the ground

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,550
It ain't hard to tell

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,050
You don't know oh oh

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,670
You don't know you're beautiful

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,920
If only you saw what I can see

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,850
You'll understand

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,970
Why I want you so desperately

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,100

Oh oh that's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on you got it wrong

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,040
To prove I'm right I put it in a so o ong

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,890
I don't know why you're being shy

28
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,260
And turn away when I look into

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,890

30
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,180

00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,100
Gets me overwhelmed
