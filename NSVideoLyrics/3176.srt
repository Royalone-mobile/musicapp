00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,500
There's only two types of people

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,450
In the world

3
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,590
The ones that entertain

4
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,870
And the ones that observe

5
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,050
Well baby, I'm a put-on-a-show

I'm like a firecracker

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,620
I make it hot

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,290
When I put on a show

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,070
I feel the adrenaline

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,340
Movin' through my veins

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,900

All eyes on me in the center of the ring

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,150
Just like a circus (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh)

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,420
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,390
Out there

32
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,310
Ones that can hang with me

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,440
And ones that are scared

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,620
So baby, I hope that you
