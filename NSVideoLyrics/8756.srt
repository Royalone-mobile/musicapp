1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
In a time of darkness and greed 

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is your light that we need 

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You came to teach us how to live

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Muhmmad, ya Rasoola Allah

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You were so caring and kind

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Your soul was full of light

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You are the best of mankind

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Muhammad, khairu khalqi Allah

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sallou ‘ala Rasooli Allah

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Habibil Mustafa

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Peace be upon the Messenger

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Chosen One

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
From luxury you turned away

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And all night you would pray

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Truthful in every word you say

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Muhammad, ya Rasoola Allah

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your face was brighter than the sun

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Your beauty equalled by none

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are Allah's Chosen One

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Muhammad, khayru khalqi Allah

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sallou ‘ala Rasooli Allah

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Habibil Mustafa

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Peace be upon the Messenger  

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Chosen One

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll try to follow your way

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And do my best to live my life

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
As you taught me

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I pray to be close to you

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
On that day, and see you smile

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When you see me

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sallou ‘ala Rasooli Allah

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Habibil Mustafa

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Peace be upon the Messenger 

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The Chosen One

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sallou ‘ala Rasooli Allah

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Habibil Mustafa

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Peace be upon the Messenger

The Chosen One

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sallou ‘ala Rasooli Allah.. Oh

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
