1
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,700
You're everything I thought you never were

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,620
And nothing like about you could've been

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,340
But still you lived inside of me

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,100
So tell me how is that

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,060
You're the only one I wish I could forget

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,060
The only one I loved and not forgive

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,340
And though you've break my heart

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,900
You're the only one

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,700
And though there are times when I hate you

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,540
Cause I can't erase the times that you hurt me

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,220
And put tears on my face

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,980
And even now I hate you its pains me to say

13
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,100
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,900
I don't wanna be without you babe

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,460
I don't want a broken heart

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,740
Don't wanna to take breath without you babe

17
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,140
I don't want to play that part

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,780
I know that I love you but let me just say

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,620
I don't wanna love you in no kinder way, no no

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,740
I don't want a broken heart

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,540
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,700
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,100
I'm no broken-hearted girl

24
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,340
There's something that I feel I need to say

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,140
But up 'til now I've always been afraid

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,220
That you would never come around

27
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,820
And still I wanna put this out

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,620
You say you got the most respect for me

29
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,580
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,060
And still you're in my heart

31
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,220
But you're the only one

32
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,500
And yes there are times when I hate you

33
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,940
But I don't complain

34
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,500
Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away

35
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,380
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say

36
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,220
That I will be there at the end of the day

37
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,340
I don't wanna be without you babe

38
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,900

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,340
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be

47
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,180
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me

48
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,820

49

I ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free

50
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,980
To spread my wings and fly away

51
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,660
away with you,

52
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,700
