1
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,440
You know you love me, I know you care

2
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,080
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there

3
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,480
You want my love, you want my heart

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,270
And we will never ever ever be apart

5
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,190
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing

6
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,370
We're just friends, what are you saying?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,660
Say there's another and look right in my eyes

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,490
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,500
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo

10
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,940
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,470
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,910
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

13
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,640
For you I would have done whatever

14
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,580
And I just can't believe we ain't together

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,200
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,140
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,360
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me

18
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,480
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,850
I'm going down, down, down, down


20
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,470
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

21
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:49,830
And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo

22
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:56,850
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:04,330
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo

24
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,740
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

25
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,550
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,

26
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,750
There was nobody that compared to my baby
and nobody came between us or could ever come above

27
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:26,910
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
she woke me up daily, dont need no Starbucks.

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,520
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat
when I see her in the street and
at school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,040
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
and now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

30
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,690
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo

31
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,960
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

32
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,990
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,520
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

34
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,780
I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
All I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,490
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,440
I'm gone
