If you want to catch a ball

11
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:36,602
But you’re havin’ no luck at all

12
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,387
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose

13
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:42,107
It hits your belly, \Nyour chin and toes

00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,919
Well try and try and try again

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,419
You put your hands out in the air,

00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:53,298
you’ll catch the ball ,\NYes this I swear,

18
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,225
Don’t give up, keep on going,

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,981
You’re on a boat, so keep on rowing

20
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:01,957
Don’t give up, don’t ever stop

21
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:04,476
Try and try and you’ll come out on top

22
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:06,114
Don’t give up

23
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:11,427
You got yourself rollerskates, \Nyou put them on

24
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:14,316
And you feel great, you stand up

25
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:18,524
Then you fall, don’t think you can skate at all

26
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:24,213
You get back up, then you trip, \Nyou skip and tip and slip, and flip,

27
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:27,613
you try and try and try some more,

28
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:30,747
Soon you’re skating across the floor,

29
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:34,750
Don’t give up, keep on moving,

30
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:37,368
You’re gonna get there, \Njust keep on grooving

31
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:40,040
Don’t give up, don’t pack it in

32
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,927
Try and try, and you’ll win

33
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:45,717
Don’t give up, no no no

34
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:48,321
Don’t give up, no no no

35
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:51,436
Don’t give up, no no no no
