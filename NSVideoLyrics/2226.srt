1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,420
Just something about you...

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,130
Way I'm lookin at you whatever

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,760
You keep lookin at me...

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,770
You gettin scared now, right?

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,590
Don't fear me baby, it's just destiny

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,900
It feel good right?...

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,820
Listen

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,350
I kind of noticed, from one night

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,400
From the club, your front face

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,830
It's kind of weird to me

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,350
Since you're so fine

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,360
If it's up to me your face will change

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,950
If you smiling that should set
the tone - just be limber

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,810
If you let go the music should groove
your bones - just remember

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,890
Sing this song with me

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,170
Ain't nobody love you like I love you

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,440
You're a good girl and that's
what makes me trust ya (hey!)

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,580
Late at night I talk to you

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,120
You will know the difference when I touch you

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,430
People are so phony

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,760
Nosy cause they're lonely

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,630
Aren't you sick of the same thing?

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,730
They say so and so was dating

24
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,960
Love you or they're hatin'

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,040
When it doesn't matter anyway

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,620
Cause we're here tonight

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:39,610
If you smiling, that should set
the tone - just be limber baby

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:47,570
If you let go, the music should groove
your bones - baby just remember

29
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,410
Sing this song with me

30
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,740
Ain't nobody love you like I love you

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,540
You're a good girl and that's
what makes me trust ya (hey!)

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,070
Late at night I talk to you

33
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,350
You will know the difference when I touch you

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,090
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,610
I could change your life

36
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,490
If you give me that chance

37
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,520
To be your man

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,590
I won't let you down baby

39
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,660
If you give me that chance

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,270
To be your man

41
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,240
Here baby, put on my jacket

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,400
And then ...

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,910

44
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,190

Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)

46
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,120
Girl ...

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,110

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,070

Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two

50
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,210
Or me and you put on a stage show

51
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,290
In the mall kids, "that's how the chain glow"

52
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,210
Point to her they say, "wow, it's the same glow"

53
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,260
Point to me I say, "yeah, it's the same dough"

54
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,600
We the same type, you my air of life

55
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,870

Take a few shots let it burn in your chest

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,810
We could ride down pumpin N.E.R.D. in the deck

59
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,560
Funny how a few words turn into sex

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,690
Play number 3, joint called "Brain"

61
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,850
Ma, take a hint, make me swerve in the lane

62
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,850

63
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,500
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,700

Ain't nobody love you like I love you

69
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,090
You're a good girl and that's
what makes me trust ya (hey!)

70
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,070
Late at night I talk to you

71
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,230
You will know the difference when I touch you

72
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,810
Break it down

73
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,540
You know, I used to dream about this
when I was a little boy

74
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,780
I never thought it would end up this way, drums

75
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:13,200
It's kind of special right? yeah...

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,410
You know, you think about it

77
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,690
Sometimes people, just destined

78
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,850
Destined to do what they do

79
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,050
And that's what it is

80
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:36,050
Now everybody dance...
