1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,700
With everything happening today

2
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,720
You dont know whether you’re coming or going

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,720
But you think that you’re on your way

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,890
Life lined up on the mirror dont blow it

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,910
Look at me when Im talkin to you

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,330
You looking at me but I’m lookin through you

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,250
I see the blood in your eyes

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,160
I see the love in disguise

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,220
I see the pain here in your pride

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,560
I see you’re not satisfied

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,200
And I dont see nobody else

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,170
I see myself I’m looking at the

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,050
Mirror on the wall, here we are again

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,920
Through my rise and fall

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,350
You’ve been my only fan

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,460
You told me that they can understand the man I am

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,620
So why are we here talkin’ to each other again

18
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,310
Oh, I see the truth in your lies

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,230
I see nobody by your side

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,060
but I’m with you when you re all alone

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,160
And you correct me when Im lookin wrong

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,260
I see that guilt beneath the shame

23
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,180
I see your soul through your window pain

24
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,470
I see the scars that remain

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,800
I see you Wayne, Im lookin at the..

26
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:44,430
Mirror on the wall, here we are again

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,430
Through my rise and fall

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,490
You’ve been my only fan

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,960
You told me that they can understand the man I am

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,350
So why are we here talkin’ to each other again

31
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,220
Lookin at me now I can see my past

32
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,420
Damn I look just like my f-ckin dad

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,380
Light it up, thats smoke at mirrors

34
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,620
I even look good in the broken mirror

35
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,630
I see my momma smile thats a blessin

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,190
I see the change, I see the message

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,100
and no message could been any clearer

38
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,430
So I’m stared with the man in the…

39
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,590
Mirror on the wall, here we are again

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,610
Through my rise and fall

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,850
You’ve been my only fan

42
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,810
You told me that they can understand the man I am

43
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,470
So why are we here talkin’ to each other again

44
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:01,220
Mirror on the wall, here we are again

45
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,230
Through my rise and fall

46
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,470
You’ve been my only fan

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,850
You told me that they can understand the man I am

48
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,280
So why are we here talkin’ to each other again

49
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:37,950
Mirror on the wall

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,800
so why are we talkin to each other again
