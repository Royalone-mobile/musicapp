1
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,500
What's wrong with the world, mama...

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,170
People livining like they ain't got no mamas

3
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,940
I think the whole world addicted to the drama

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,980
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,930
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism

6
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,500
But we still got terrorists here livining

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,570
In the USA, the big CIA

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,500
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,060
But if you only have love for your own race

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,460
Then you only leave space to discriminate

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,020
And to discriminate only generates hate

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,780
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,170
Madness is what you demonstrate

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,850
And that's exactly how anger works and operates

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,530
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,500
Take control of your mind and meditate

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,300
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,780
People killining, people dyining

19
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,340
Children hurt and you hear them cryining

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,900
Can you practice what you preach

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,500
And would you turn the other cheek

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,140
Father, Father, Father help us

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,460
Send some guidance from above

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,700
'Cause people got me, got me questionining

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,570
Where is the love (Love)

26
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,570
Where is the love (The love)

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,290
Where is the love (The love)

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,570
Where is the love, The love, the love

29
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:32,780
It just ain't the same, always unchanged
Where is the love, The love, the love

30
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,180
It just ain't the same, always unchanged

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,570
New days are strange, is the world insane

32
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,140
If love and peace is so strong

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,370
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong

34
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,780
Nations droppin' bombs

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,100
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,780
With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young

37
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,060
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,620
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong

39
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,340
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin'
in

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,850
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends

41
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,540
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,900
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover

43
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,290
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug

44
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,930
If you never know truth then you never know love

45
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,420
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)

46
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,970
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)

47
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,900
Where's the love, y'all

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,180
People killin', people dyin'

49
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,780
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'

50
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,180
Can you practice what you preach

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,740
And would you turn the other cheek

52
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,580
Father, Father, Father help us

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,810
Send some guidance from above

54
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,140
'Cause people got me, got me questioning'

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,970
Where is the love (Love)

56
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,780
Where is the love (The love)

57
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,090
Where is the love, The love, the love

58
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,420
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder

59
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,140
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder

60
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,580
Most of us only care about money makin'

61
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,250
Selfishness got us followin' our wrong direction

62
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,650
Wrong information always shown by the media

63
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,370
Negative images is the main criteria

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,900
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria

65
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,580
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema

66
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,140
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,900
Whatever happened to the fairness in equality

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,370
Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity

69
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,020
Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity

70
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,530
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under

71
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,210
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down

72
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,740
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,420
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (so ask yourself)

74
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:35,580
Where is The Love?

75
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,060
Father, Father, Father help us

76
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,500
Send us some guidance from above

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,530
'Cause people got me, got me questioning'

78
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,980
Where is the love?

79
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,580
Sing wit my ya'll

80
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,300
One world one world, We only got one world one world

81
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,340
That’s all we got one world one world

82
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,580
Somthins wrong wit it (yeah)
Somthins wrong wit wwwworld world world yeah

83
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,650
We only got one world one world
That’s all we got one world one world
