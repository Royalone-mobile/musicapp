00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,770
Ladies and gentlemen

00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,920
we interrupt our program of dance music

00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,340
from the intercontinental radio news

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,450

Yeah

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,190
You don't like me, I don't like you, It don't matter

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,100
Only difference, you still listen, I don't have to

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,030
In one ear and out the other, I dont need ya

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,940
Your words don't stick, I ain't perfect but you ain't either

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,650
If you're feelin' grubbily, I ain't even losin' sleep

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,750
Theres more to me than what you see

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,460
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,370
Mr. Photographer, I think I'm ready for my close-up (tonight!)

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,280

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,230
or you're happy to see me?

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,150

I've felt you, watching me watching you

30
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,920
Kill the Lights!

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,140
You can't handle the truth, what happened to you?

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,020
I killed the lights (Pure satisfaction)

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,010
I killed the lights (Lights, camera, action)

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,810
I killed the lights (Pure satisfaction)

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,770
I killed the lights (Lights, camera, action)
