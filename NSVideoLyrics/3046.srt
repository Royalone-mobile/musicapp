1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,800
Hey baby how you doing?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,100
You know Im gonna cut right to the chase.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,650
Some women were made,

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,450
but me, myself.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,850
I like to think I was created,

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,850
for a special purpose.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,200
I mean, whats more special than you, you feel me?

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,550
Its a long way but lets get lost.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,650
You dont need to call into work, cuz you're the boss.

10
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,250
For real want you to show me how you feel,

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,100
I consider myself lucky thats a big deal.

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,450
I well you got the key to my heart,

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,900
but you aint gonna need it.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,450
I'd rather you open up my body.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,950
And show me secrets.

16
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,600
You didnt know was inside,

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,900
No need for me to lie.

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,750
It's too big,

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,300
It's too wide,

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,950
It's too strong,

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,500
It wont fit,

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
It's too much,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,550
It's too tough,

24
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,650
He talks like this,

25
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,400
Cuz he can back it up.

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,150
He got a big ego,

27
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,400
Such a huge ego,

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
I love his big ego,

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,800
It's too much,

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,100
He walks like this,

31
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,650
cuz he can back it up.

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,150
Usually I'm humble,

33
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,600
but right now I dont choose.

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,900
You can leave with me,

35
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,650
or you could have the blues.

36
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,200
Some call it arrogant.

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,950
I call it confidant.

38
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,450
You decide when you find,

39
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,100
on what I'm working with.

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,600
Damn I know, I'm killing you with them legs.

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,900
Better yet them thighs.

42
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,450
Matter a fact its my smile,

43
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,900
or maybe my eyes.

44
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,750
Boy you a site to see,

45
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,500
kind of something like me.

46
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,250
It's too big,

47
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,550
