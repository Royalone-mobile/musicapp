1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,910
Everywhere I'm turning

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,650
Nothing seems complete

3
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,770
I stand up and I'm searching

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,880
For the better part of me

5
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:42,190
I hang my head from sorrow

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,740
Slave to humanity

7
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,950
I wear it on my shoulders

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,290
Gotta find the strength in me

9
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:05,150
Cause I am a Superwoman

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,640
Yes I am

11
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,010
Yes she is

12
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,760
Even when I'm a mess

13
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,010
I still put on a vest

14
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,500
With an S on my chest

15
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,440
Oh yes

16
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,750
I'm a Superwoman

17
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:29,170
For all the mothers fighting

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,970
For better days to come

19
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:41,150
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,220
To come home before the sun

21
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,780
And all my sisters

22
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,710
Coming together

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,960
Say yes I will

24
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,390
Yes I can

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,190
Cause I am a Superwoman

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,810
Yes I am

27
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,180
Yes she is

28
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,800
Even when I'm a mess

29
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,110
I still put on a vest

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,670
With an S on my chest

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,610
Oh yes

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,170
I'm a Superwoman

33
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,420
When I'm breaking down

34
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,380
And I can't be found

35
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,990
And I start to get weak

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,360
Cause no one knows

37
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,230
Me underneath these clothes

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,280
But I can fly

39
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:52,020
We can fly, Oooohh

40
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,890
Cause I am a Superwoman

41
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,570
Yes I am

42
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,190
Yes she is

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,690
Even when I'm a mess

44
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,190
I still put on a vest

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,760
With an S on my chest

46
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,690
Oh yes

47
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,880
I'm a Superwoman

48
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,950
Yes she is

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,140
Let me tell you I am a Superwoman

50
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,790
Yes I am

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,670
Yes she is

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,230
Even when I'm a mess

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,730
I still put on a vest

54
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,350
With an S on my chest

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,480
Oh yes

56
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,910
I'm a Superwoman

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,190
Yes I am

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,530
And I am a Superwoman

59
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,480
Yes she is

60
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:56,530
Lalalalala...Super..Super..
