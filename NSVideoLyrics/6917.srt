1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,170
I can't sleep, I'm feeling wide awake

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,730
Tonight is taking it's time

3
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,780
How much more before the morning breaks

4
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:43,030
And I can leave it all behind

5
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,710
'Cause every time I try to close my eyes

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,580
I only end up seeing memories of you

7
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,390
And it's never enough, I'm waiting

8
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,190
Even though you're gone I can hear your heart

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,870
It's calling out my name like a flash in the dark

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,410
If this is just a dream

11
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,840
I won't give it back

12
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,300
I'll find a way to make it last

13
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,670
One more minute, wait, wait, wait, don't go

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,670
Just one more minute, wait, wait, wait, don't go

15
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,460
I am keeping every word you say

16
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,640
But how much longer can I hold on

17
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,710
Cause whispers echoing until they fade

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,080
Remind me that you're already gone

19
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,640
'Cause every time I try to chase your voice

20
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,640
I end up getting lost and running in circles

21
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,630
And it's never enough, I'm waiting

22
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,190
Even though you're gone I can hear your heart

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,930
It's calling out my name like a flash in the dark

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,310
If this is just a dream

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,550
I won't give it back

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,420
I'll find a way to make it last

27
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,910
One more minute wait, wait, wait, don't go

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,970
Just one more minute, wait, wait, wait, don't go

29
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,220
Wait, wait, wait, don't go

30
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:37,770
Just one more minute, wait, wait, wait, don't go

31
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,260
Oooh yeah, don't go

32
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,180
Even though you're gone I can hear your heart

33
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,180
It's calling out my name like a flash in the dark

34
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,100
If this is just a dream

35
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,230
I won't give it back

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,540
I'll find a way to make it last

37
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,100
One more minute, wait, wait, wait, don't go

38
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:17,150
Just one more minute, wait, wait, wait, don't go
