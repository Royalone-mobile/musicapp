1
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,340
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face

2
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,740
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away

3
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,840
If only I knew what I know today

4
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,260
Ooh, ooh

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,230
I would hold you in my arms

6
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,840
I would take the pain away

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,520
Thank you for all you've done

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,190
Forgive all your mistakes

9
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,300
There's nothing I wouldn't do

10
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,720
To hear your voice again

11
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,640
Sometimes I wanna call you

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,810
But I know you won't be there

13
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,960
Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,560
For everything I just couldn't do

15
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:59,270
And I've hurt myself by hurting you

16
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,680
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,650
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss

18
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,510
And it's so hard to say goodbye

19
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,740
When it comes to this, oooh

20
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,520
Would you tell me I was wrong?

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,880
Would you help me understand?

22
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,920
Are you looking down upon me?

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,540
Are you proud of who I am?

24
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,450
There's nothing I wouldn't do

25
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,880
To have just one more chance

26
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,800
To look into your eyes

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,030
And see you looking back

28
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:57,060
Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you

29
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,780
For everything I just couldn't do

30
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,380
And I've hurt myself, ohh

31
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,600
If I had just one more day

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,400
I would tell you how much that I've missed you

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,880
Since you've been away

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,920
Ooh, it's dangerous

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,520
It's so out of line

36
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:42,900
To try and turn back time

37
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,930
I'm sorry for blaming you

38
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,340
For everything I just couldn't do

39
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:18,050
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
