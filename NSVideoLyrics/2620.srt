1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,670
I got you a little something.

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,930
- Again?
- Yeah

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,270
- It's beautiful.
- Wanna put it on?

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,160
Yeah....  I love it.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,360
- You do?
- Thank you.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,110
Wait, is that your dad?

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:38,890
   

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,340
You'll never see him again

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,720
   

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,520
You understand that?

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:01:21,940
   

12
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,500
You’ve got that smile

13
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,600
That only heaven can make

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,630
I pray to God everyday

15
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,670
That you keep that smile

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,710
Yeah, you are my dream

17
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,100
There’s not a thing I won’t do

18
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,390
I’ll give my life up for you

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,790
Cuz you are my dream

20
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,380
And baby, everything that I have is yours

21
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,520
You will never go cold or hungry

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,540
I’ll be there when you’re insecure

23
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,630
Let you know that you’re always lovely

24
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:12,860
Girl, cos you are the only thing that I got right now

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,720
One day when the sky is falling

26
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,820
I’ll be standing right next to you

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,060
Right next to you

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,530
Nothing will ever come between us

29
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,770
I’ll be standing right next to you

30
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,360
Right next to you

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,980
You had my child

32
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,180
You make my life complete

33
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,220
Just to have your eyes on little me

34
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,710
That’d be mine forever

35
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,160
And baby, everything that I have is yours

36
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,320
You will never go cold or hungry

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,220
I’ll be there when you’re insecure

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,240
Let you know that you’re always lovely

39
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,670
Girl, cos you are the only thing that I got right now

Me and you

48
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,320
And I have no fear

49
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,050
I know we’ll make it through

50
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,590
One day when the sky is falling

51
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,120
I’ll be standing right next to you

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:40,930

Stand by my side

60
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,260
When the sky falls

61
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,590
I’ll be there

62
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,640
I’ll be there

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,570
You’ve got that smile

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,450

66
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,000
To keep you forever
