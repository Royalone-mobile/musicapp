1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,250
It's late at night and I can't sleep

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,550
Missing you just runs too deep

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,450
Oh I can't breathe thinking of your smile

4
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,450
Every kiss I can't forget

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,650
This aching heart ain't broken yet

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:42,850
Oh God I wish I could make you see

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,650
Cuz I know this flame isn't dying

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,150
So nothing can stop me from trying

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,950
Baby you know that

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,250
Maybe it's time for miracles

11
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,250
Cuz I ain't giving up on love

12
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,750
You know that

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,450
Maybe it's time for miracles

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,650
Cuz I ain't giving up on love

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,950
No I ain't giving up on us

16
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,650
I just want to be with you

17
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,050
Cuz living is so hard to do

18
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,150
When all I know is trapped inside your eyes

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,950
The future I cannot forget

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,150
This aching heart ain't broken yet

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,950
Oh God I wish I could make you see

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,150
Cuz I know this flame isn't dying

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,150
So nothing can stop me from trying

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,150
Baby you know that

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,350
Maybe it's time for miracles

No I ain't giving up on us

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,250
Baby can you feel it coming

32
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,550
You know I can hear it, hear it, the souls

33
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:23,350
Baby, you feel, they feel you

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,150
You know it's time

35
