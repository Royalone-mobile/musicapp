00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,310
I've been walking
2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,360
In the same way as I did
3
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,380
Missing out
4
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,870
The cracks in the pavement
5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,600
And tutting my heel
6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,940
And strutting my feet
7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,980
Is there anything
8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,900
I can do for you dear?
9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,060
Is there anyone I could call?
10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,710
No and thank you, please Madam
11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,650
I ain't lost, just wandering
12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,860
Round my hometown
13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,570
Memories are fresh
14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,650
Round my hometown
15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,750
Ooh, the people I've met
16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,270
Are the wonders of my world
17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,220
Are the wonders of my world
18
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,410
Are the wonders of this world
19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,390
Are the wonders of my world
20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,630
I like it in the city
21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,940
When the air
22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,150
Is so thick and opaque
23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,460
I love to see everybody
24
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,650
In short skirts
25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,920
Shorts and shades
26
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,750
I like it in the city
27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,490
When two worlds collide
28
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,590
You get the people
29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,560
And the government
30
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,070
Everybody taking
31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,910
Different sides
32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,510
Shows that
33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,980
We ain't gonna stand shit
34
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,590
Shows
35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,100
That we are united
36
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,580
Shows
37
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,440
That we ain't gonna take it
38
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:00,880
Shows
39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,890
That we ain't gonna stand shit
40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,900
Shows that we are united
41
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,480
Round my hometown
42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,740
Memories are fresh
43
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,430
Round my hometown
44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,950
Ooh the people I've met
45
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,230
Are the wonders of my world
46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,190
Are the wonders of my world
47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,610
Are the wonders of this world
48
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,160
Are the wonders of my world
