1
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,790
You say that
I'm messing with your head

2
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,010
All 'cause I was making out
with your friend

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,600
Love hurts
whether it's right or wrong

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,910
I can't stop
'cause I'm having too much fun

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,350
You're on your knees

6
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,380
Begging please,
stay with me

7
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,560
But honestly,

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,550
I just need to be
a little crazy

9
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,590
All my life I've been good,
but now

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm thinking
"what the hell"

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,930
All I want is
to mess around

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,330
And I don't
really care about

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,750
If you love me,
if you hate me

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,740
You can't save me,
baby,

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,840
All my life I've been good,
but now

16
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,120
Whoa,
what the hell

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,000
What?

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,530
What?

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,180
What?

20
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,340
What the hell?

21
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,170
So what if I go out on
a million dates

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,070
You never call
or listen to me anyway

23
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,930
I'd rather rage
than sit around and wait all day

24
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,490
Don't get me wrong,
I just need some time to play

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,570
You're on your knees

26
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,850
Begging please,
stay with me

27
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,960
But honestly,

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,010
I just need to be
a little crazy

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,070
All my life I've been good,
but now

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,270
I'm thinking
"what the hell"

31
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,350
All I want is
to mess around

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,690
And I don't
really care about

33
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,130
If you love me,
if you hate me

34
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,140
You can't save me,
baby,

35
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,160
All my life I've been good,
but now

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,480
Whoa,
what the hell

37
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,370
You say that
I'm messing with your head, boy

38
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,830
I like messing
in your bed

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,970
Yeah,
I'm messing with your head

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,800
When I'm messing
with you in bed

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,490
All my life I've been good,
but now

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,230
I'm thinking
"what the hell"

43
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,980
All I want is
to mess around

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,700
And I don't
really care about

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,390
All my life I've been good,
but now

46
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,720
I'm thinking
"what the hell"

47
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,750
All I want is
to mess around

48
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,200
And I don't
really care about

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,750
If you love me,
if you hate me

50
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,560
You can't save me,
baby,

51
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,640
All my life I've been good,
but now

52
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,890
Whoa,
what the hell
