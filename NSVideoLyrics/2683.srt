1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:10,200
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else, hey

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,520
You made my insecure

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,950
To me I wasn't good enough

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,250
But who are you to judge

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,660
When you're diamond in the rough

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,890
I'm sure you got some things

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,390
You like to change about yourself

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,590
But when it comes to me

Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na na

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,430
I'm no beauty queen, I'm just beautiful me

You got every right to a beautiful life

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:47,950
Come on!

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,980
Who says

18
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,390
Who says you're not perfect

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,390
Who says you're the only one that's hurting

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,890
Trust me that's the price of beauty

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,300

It's such a funny thing

26
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,630
How nothing's funny when it's you

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,910
You tell me what you need

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,420
But they can widen out the the truth

29
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,710
It's like a work of art

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,140
But never gets to see the lights

31
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,570
Keep you beneath the stars

32
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,350
While I can touch the sky

33
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,030
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na na
