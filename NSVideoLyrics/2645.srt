1
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,150
She keeps the secrets in her eyes

2
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,020
She wraps the truth inside her lies

3
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,750
And just when i can't take what she's done to me

4
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,690
She comes to me

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,760
And leads me back to paradise

6
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:52,610
She's so hard to hold But I can't let go

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,120
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane

8
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,640
A reckless ride in the pouring rain

9
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,670
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel

10
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,160
She danced away just like a child

11
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,490
She drives me crazy drives me wild

12
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,990
But I'm helpless when she smiles

13
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,260
Oh.. when she smiles

14
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,310
she smile

15
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:38,520
Maybe I'd fight it if I could

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,240
It hurts so bad, but feels so good

17
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,400
She opens up just like a rose to me

18
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,450
When she's close to me

19
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,210
Anything she asked me to, I would

20
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:10,400
It's out of control But I can't let go...

21
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,990
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane

22
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,530
A reckless ride in the pouring rain

23
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,290
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel

24
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,890
She danced away just like a child

25
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,270
She drives me crazy drives me wild

26
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,740
But I'm helpless when she smiles

27
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,450
Oh.. when she smiles

28
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,320
When she looks at me

29
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,370
I.. get so weak

30
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,810
I'm a house of cards in a hurricane

31
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,490
A reckless ride in the pouring rain

32
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,860
She cuts me and the pain is all I wanna feel

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,850
She danced away just like a child

34
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:25,190
She drives me crazy drives me wild

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,480
But I'm helpless when she smiles

36
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,730
Oh.. when she smiles

37
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,720
when she smiles

38
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,970
She smiles

39
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:52,670
when she smiles
