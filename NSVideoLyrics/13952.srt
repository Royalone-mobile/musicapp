1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,749
Can you tell me how can one miss

2
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,648
What she's never had

3
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:14,181
How could I reminisce when there is no past

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:19,093
How could I have memories of being happy with you boy

5
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,300
Could someone tell me how can this be

6
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:26,698
How could my mind pull up incidents

7
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:30,830
Recall dates and times that never happened

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,122
How could we celebrate a love that's to late

9
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:40,755
And how could I really mean the words I'm bout to say

10
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:48,866
I missed the times that we almost shared

11
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:52,747
I miss the love that was almost there

12
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:56,546
I miss the times that we use to kiss

13
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,064
At least in my dreams

14
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:00,754
Just let me take my time and reminisce

15
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,335
I miss the times that we never had

16
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,283
What happened to us we were almost there

17
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,505
Whoever said it's impossible to miss when you never had

18
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:20,274
Never almost had you

19
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:35,111
I cannot believe I let you go

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,401
Or what I should say I shoulda grabbed you up and never let you go

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,261
I shoulda went out with you

22
00:01:42,526 --> 00:01:45,024
I shoulda made you my boo boy

23
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,835
Yes that's one time I shoulda broke the rules

24
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:49,795
I shoulda went on a date

25
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:51,571
Shoulda found a way to escape

26
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,634
Shoulda turned a almost into

27
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:55,397
If it happend now its to late

28
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:59,041
How could I celebrate a love that wasn't real

29
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:02,401
And if it didn't happen why does my heart feel

30
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,727
I missed the times that we almost shared

31
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:09,475
I miss the love that was almost there

32
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:13,211
I miss the times that we use to kiss

33
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:14,663
At least in my dreams

34
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:17,127
Just let me take my time and reminisce

35
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:20,693
I miss the times that we never had

36
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:24,586
What happened to us we were almost there

37
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:30,730
Whoever said it's impossible to miss when you never had

38
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:40,041
Never almost had you
