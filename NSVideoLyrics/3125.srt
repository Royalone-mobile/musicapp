1
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,700
And it's a sad picture

2
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,440
The final blow hits you

3
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:31,420
Somebody else gets what you wanted again

4
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,930
You know it's all the same

5
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,430
Another time and place

6
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,030
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it

7
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,810
But I believe in whatever you do

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,330
And I'll do anything to see it through

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,950
Because these things will change

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,400
Can you feel it now?

11
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,640
These walls that they put up  to hold us back will fall down

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:08,740
It's a revolution,   the time will come for us to finally win

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,490
We'll sing hallelujah!

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:23,680
We'll sing hallelujah! Oh

15
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,480
So we've been outnumbered,

16
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,000
Raided and now cornered

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,870
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,950
We're getting stronger now  from things they never found

19
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,890
They might be bigger  but we're faster and never scared

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,290
You can walk away  and say we don't need this

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,210
But there's something in your eyes  says we can beat this

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,580
'Cause these things will change

23
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,040
Can you feel it now?

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,130
These walls that they put up   to hold us back will fall down

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,590
It's a revolution

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,920
The time will come for us to finally win

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,960
We'll sing hallelujah!

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,690
We'll sing hallelujah! Oh

29
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,150
Tonight we standed on our knees

30
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,190
To fight for what we worked for all these years

31
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,670
And the battle was long

32
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,070
It's the fight of our lives

33
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,760
Will we stand up champions tonight?

34
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,990
It was the night things changed

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,460
Can you see it now?

36
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,620
These walls that they put up  to hold us back fell down

37
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,200
It's a revolution, throw your hands up

38
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,620
Cause we never gave in

39
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,790
We'll sing hallelujah!

40
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,320
We sang hallelujah!

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:48,850
Hallelujah!
