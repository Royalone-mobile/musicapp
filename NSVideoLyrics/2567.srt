You ain't here to party (woo!)

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,280

00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,450
Gentlemen (move)

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,880
Somebody ring the alarm

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,080
A fire on the roof

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:43,000
Ring the alarm (and I'm throwin' elbows)

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,260
Oh, I'm overdue

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,700
Give me some room

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,060
I'm coming through

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,190

Sweat until my clothes come off

22
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,190
It's explosive, speakers are pumping (oh)

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,970
Still jumping, six in the morning

24
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,200
Table dancing, glasses are mashing

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,960
No question, time for some action

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,290
Temperature's up (can you feel it)

27
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,020

We're still going, eight in the morning

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,730
There's no stopping, we keep it popping (oh)

00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,390
Hot rocking, everyone's talking

Yup, that's what's up

73
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,890
You can just put your butt

74
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,760
To the maximum

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,300
Uh oh, here we go (here we go)

76
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,100
You can tell when the music

77
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,090
Starts to drop

78
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,390
That's when we take it

79
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,530
To the parking lot

80
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,140
And I bet you somebody's gonna

81
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,020

Redman: Yo, hot damn, Doc a jam like a summer show

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,500
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove

86
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,580
My gear look like the bank got my money froze

87
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,990
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,440
The club is packed, the bar is filled

94
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,540
I'm waiting for sister to act, like Lauryn Hill

95
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,810
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals

96
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,180
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels

97
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,160
Throw it up

98

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,930
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in

101
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,820
