1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,020
People can take everything away from you

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,290
But they can never take away your truth

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,400
But the question is...

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,900
Can you handle mine?

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,440
They say I'm crazy

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,620
I really don't care

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,900
That's my Prerogative

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,170
They say I'm nasty

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,950
But I don't give a damn

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,320
Getting boys is how I live

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,750
Some ask me questions

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,370
Why am I so real?

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,590
But they don't understand me

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,140
I really don't know the deal

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,360
About my sister

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,400
Trying hard to make it right

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,470
Not long ago before I won this fight

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,480
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,860
Why don't they just let me live (Tell me why)

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,910
I don't need permission

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,660
Make my own decisions (oh)

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:26,290
That's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)

23
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:33,240
It's my prerogative

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,140
It's the way that I wanna live

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,410
It's my prerogative

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,920
You can't tell me what to do

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,830
Don't get me wrong

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm really not souped

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,140
Ego trips is not my thing

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,650
All these strange relationships

31
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,950
Really gets me down

32
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,010
I see nothing wrong with

33
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,460
Spreading myself around

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,500
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,880
Why don't they just let me live (Tell me why)

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't need permission

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,620
Make my own decisions (oh)

38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,780
That's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,720
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me

You can't tell me what to do

47
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:57,250
Why can't I live my life

48
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:08,260
Without all of the things that people say oooooh

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,800
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,160
Why don't they just let me live (Tell me why)

(they say I'm nasty)

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,500
I don't need permission

59
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,080
