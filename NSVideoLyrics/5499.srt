1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,420
If you ever leave me, baby

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,840
Leave some morphine at my door

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,120
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,620
To realize what we used to have

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,300
We don't have it anymore

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,180
There's no religion that could save me

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,620
No matter how long my knees are on the floor

8
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:47,210
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,260
To keep you by my side

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,120
And keep you from walkin' out the door

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,730
Cause there'll be no sunlight

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,950
If I lose you, baby

13
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,080
And there'll be no clear skies

14
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,350
If I lose you, baby

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,900
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:18,130
If you walk away, everyday it will rain

17
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,640
Rain,

18
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,250
I'll never be your mother's favorite

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,610
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye

20
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,840
If I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing

21
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,750
Sayin' there goes my little girl

22
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,510
Walkin' with that troublesome guy

23
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,590
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,680
But little darlin' watch me change their minds

25
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,580
Yeah, for you I'll try,

26
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,100
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'till I'm bleeding

27
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,040
If that'll make it right

28
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,470
Cause there'll be no sunlight

29
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,800
If I lose you, baby

30
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,870
And there'll be no clear skies

31
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,210
If I lose you, baby

32
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,540
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,820
If you walk away, everyday it will rain

34
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,330
Rain,

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:20,980
Don't you say, goodbye

36
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,960
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding

37
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,130
If that'll make it right

38
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,480
Cause there'll be no sunlight

39
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,540
If I lose you, baby

40
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,990
And there'll be no clear skies

41
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,040
If I lose you, baby

42
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,580
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,850
If you walk away, everyday it will rain

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,470
Rain,
