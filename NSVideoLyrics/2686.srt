00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,570
How you choose to express yourself

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,190
Its all your own and I can tell

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,130

And to me it's exciting,

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,930
When you know it's meant to be,

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,490
Everything comes naturally,
