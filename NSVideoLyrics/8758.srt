00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I praise Allah for sending me you my love

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You've found your home it's here with me

Now let me let you know

You've opened my heart 

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I was always thinking that love was wrong

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But everything was changed when you came along

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And there's a couple of words I want to say

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
For the rest of my life, I'll be with you

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll stay by your side, honest and true

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Till the end of my time

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll be loving you, loving you

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
For the rest of my life, through days and nights 

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I’ll thank Allah for opening my eyes 

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I feel so blessed when I think of you

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I ask Allah to bless all we do

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're my wife, and my friend and my strength

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And I pray we're together in Jannah

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Finally now I've found my self, I feel so strong 

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes everything was changed when you came along
