Can you feel me

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,150
When i think about you

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,240
With every breath i take

5
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,200
Every Minute

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,890
Not matter what i do

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,420
My world is an empty place

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:42,150
Like ive been wonderin the dessert,for a thousand days ( oooh ).

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:50,390
Don't know if its a mirage,but i always see your face, Baby..

Can't help it, I'm in love

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,330
A day without you is like a year without rain.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,210
I need you by my side,

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,800
Don't know how I'll survive

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:11,850
But a day without you is like a year without rain ( oooh )

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:21,830
Ooooooooooh

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,350
The stars are burning,

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,220
I hear your voice in my mind ( in my mind )

19
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,390
Can't you hear me calling.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,800
My Heart is yearning,

21
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,670
Like the ocean is running dry

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,390
Catch me i'm falling

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,640
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet,

24
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,640
Won't you save me

25
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,700
There's gonna be a monsoon

26
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,260
when you get back to me( ooooh Baby )

27
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,240
I'm missing you so much

28
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,410
Can't help it, I'm in love

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,560
A day without you is like a year without rain.

I need you by my side,

31

Don't know how I'll survive

32
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:15,350
But a day without you is like a year without rain ( oooh )

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:25,710
Ooooooooooh

So let this drought come to an end

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,610
And make this dessert flower again

36

37
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:50,500

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,290
I'm missing you so much

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,370
A day without you is like a year without rain.

I need you by my side,

42
