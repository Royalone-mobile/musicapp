1
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,420
Another ringer with the slick trigger finger

2
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,470
For Her Majesty

3
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,660
Another one with the golden tongue

4
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,160
Poisoning your fantasy

5
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,040
Another bill from a killer

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,500
Turned a thriller to a tragedy

7
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,430
A door left open

8
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,990
A woman walking by

9
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,620
A drop in the water

10
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,360
A look in the eye

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,110
A phone on the table

12
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,740
A man on your side

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,300
Oh, someone that you think that you can trust

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,120
Is just

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,480
Another way to die

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:37,620
   

17
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,430
Another tricky little gun

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,120
Giving solace to the one

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,300
That will never see the sunshine

20
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,680
Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother,

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,110
In the nick of time

22
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,740
Another dirty money heaven sent honey

23
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Turning on a dime

24
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,300
Well, a door left open

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,930
A woman walking by

26
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,610
A drop in the water

27
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,180
A look in the eye

28
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,990
A phone on the table

29
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,740
A man on your side

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,180
Someone that you think that you can trust

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,050
Is just

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,800
Another way to die

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,170
   

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,250
(it's just another)

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:26,080
Hey! Another way to die!

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,020
(Another way to die& )

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,490
Shoot 'em, bang bang!

38
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:39,490
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!

39
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:49,070
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

40
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:58,620
   

41
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,180
Another girl with her finger

42
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,800
On the world singing to

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,050
you what you wanna hear?

44
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,800
Another gun thrown down and surrendered

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,300
Took away your fear

46
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,800
Hey!

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,550
Another man that stands right behind you

48
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,000
Looking in the mirror

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,050
Oh, a door left open

50
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,740
A woman walking by

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,550
A drop in the water

52
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,180
A look in the eye

53
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,870
A phone on the table

54
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,620
A man on your side

55
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,050
Someone that you think that you can trust

56
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,990
Is just

57
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,000
Another way to die

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,230
   

59
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:43,730
It's another way!

60
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,920
Shoot 'em up, bang bang!

61
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,420
Hey! Hey! Hey!

62
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,750
(Another way, another way)

63
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,250
Yeah!

64
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:08,910
(Another way, another way)

65
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,910
Bang bang bang bang!
