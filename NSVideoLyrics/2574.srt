1
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,740
Yeah come on

2
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,340
I wanna thank you

3
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,980
for giving me time to breathe

4
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,140
Like a rock you waited so patiently

5
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,180
While I got it together

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,940
While I figured it out

7
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,260
I only looked but I never touched

8
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,540
'Cause in my heart

9
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,740
was a picture of us

10
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,500
Holdin' hands, makin' plans

11
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,380
and it's lucky for me you understand

12
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,940
What a girl wants

13
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,660
What a girl needs

14
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,460
Whatever makes me happy sets you free

15
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,100
And I'm thanking you

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,180
for knowing exactly

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,860
What a girl wants

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,540
What a girl needs

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,660
Whatever keeps me in your arms

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,340
And I'm thanking you

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,900
for giving it to me

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,380
What I want is what you got

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,700
And what you got is what I want

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,660
There was a time I was blind

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,820
I was so confused

26
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,300
Run away just to hide it all from you

27
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,660
But baby you knew me better,

28
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,420
than I knew myself

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,700
They say if you love something

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,020
let it go

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,740
If it comes back it's yours

32
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,740
That's how you know

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,300
It's for keeps, yeah,

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,660
it's for sure

35
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,180
And you're ready and willin'

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,700
To give me more than

37
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,060
What a girl wants

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,660
What a girl needs

39
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,540
Whatever makes me happy sets you free

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,100
And I'm thanking you

41
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,220

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,900
What a girl wants

43
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,580
What a girl needs

44
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,700
Whatever keeps me in your arms

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,260
And I'm thanking you

46
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,100

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,580
What a girl wants

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,060
What a girl needs

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,380
Somebody sensitive,

50
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,660
crazy, sexy, cool like you

51
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,220

56
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,820
(It's okay)

57
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,180
You let a girl know

58
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,380
how much you care about her

59
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,540
I swear you're the one who always knew

60
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,300
You knew

61
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,820
Ooh, oh I'm thanking you

62
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,900
for being there for me

63
