1
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:19,870
Comparisons are easily done

2
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:26,110
Once you've had a taste of perfection

3
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,950
Like an apple hanging from a tree I picked the

4
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:39,790
ripest one, I still got the seed

5
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,710
You said move on,Where do I go?

6
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,270
I guess second best Is all I will know-

7
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,350
Cause when I'm with him I am..

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,470
..thinking of you-

9
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,670
Thinking of you-

10
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,150
What you would do if

11
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,550
You were the one Who was

12
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,150
spending the night

13
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,630
Oh I wish that I

14
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,710
Was looking into your..

15
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,710
You're like an Indian summer

16
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,230
In the middle of winter

17
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,150
Like a hard candy

18
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,350
With a surprise center

19
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,630
How do I get better

20
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,990
Once I've had the best?

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,270
You said there's Tons of fish in the water

22
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,310
So the waters I will test

23
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,430
He kissed my lips

24
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,790
I taste your mouth

25
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,030
He pulled me in

26
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,750
I was disgusted with myself

27
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,550
Cause when I'm with him, I am..

28
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,110
thinking of you

29
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,510
thinking of you

30
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,910
What you would do if

31
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,710
You were the one Who was

32
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,430
spending the night

33
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,430
Oh I wish that I

34
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,270
Was looking into...

35
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,670
You're the best And yes I do regret

36
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,590
How I could let myself

37
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,830
Let you go

38
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,550
Now

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,830
now the lesson's learnedy

40
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,950
I touched it I was burned

41
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,150
Oh I think you should

42
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,630
know

43
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,910
Cause when I'm with him I am

44
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,190
thinking of you

45
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,750
thinking of you

46
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,150
What you would do if

47
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,950
You were the one Who was

48
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,430
spending the night

49
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,150
Oh I wish that I

50
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,710
Was looking into your eyes

51
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,190
Looking into your eyes

52
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,670
Looking into your eyes

53
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,670
Oh won't you walk through, And

54
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,710
bust in the door

55
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,550
And take me away

56
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,670
Oh no more mistakes

57
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,830
Cause in your eyes

58
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,950
I'd like to stay...

59
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,310
