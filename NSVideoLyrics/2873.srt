1
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,950
Even if you were a million miles away

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,950
I could still feel you in my bed

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,950
Near me, touch me, feel me

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,950
And even at the bottom of the sea

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,950
I could still hear inside my head

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,950
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,950
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,450
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

9
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,450
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

10
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,950
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,950
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,950
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,950
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,950
Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,950
You wore the crown

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,950
You made my body feel heaven bound

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,350
Why don't you hold me

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,950
Near me, I thought you told me

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,950
You'd never leave me

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,350
Looking in the sky I could see your face

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,950
And I know right where I fit in

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,950
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,950
With you

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,950
Right til the end OOh

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,950
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,950
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,350
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,350
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,950
Anybody could've told you right from the start

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,950
It's about to fall apart

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,950
So rather than hold on to a broken dream

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,950
Or just hold on to love

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,950
And I could find a way to make it

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,950
Don't hold on too tight

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,950
I'll make it without you tonight

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,950
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,950
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,950
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,950
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
