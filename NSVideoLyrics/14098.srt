00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,930
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago

2
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,120
I was in your sights, you got me alone

3
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,610
You found me

4
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,250
You found me

5
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,120
You found me-e-e-e

6
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,440
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I like that

7
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,560
And when I fell hard, you took a step back

8
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,120
Without me,

9
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,740
Without me

10
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,770
Without me-e-e-e-e-e...

11
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,090
And he's long gone, when he's next to me

12
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,790
And I realize the blame is on me

13
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,780
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in

14
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,070
So shame on me now

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,890
Flew me to places I'd never been

16
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,640
Til you put me down

17
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,390
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in

18
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,540
So shame on me now

19
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,400
Flew me to places I'd never been

20
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,910
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

21
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,250
Oh, oh

22
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,350
Trouble, trouble, trouble

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,540
Oh, oh

24
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,530
Trouble, trouble, trouble

25
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,720
No apologizes, he'll never see you cry

26
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,850
Pretend he doesn't know, that he's the reason why

27
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,980
You're drowning, you're drowning

28
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,850
You're drowni-i-i-i-ng

29
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,150
And I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street

30
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,230
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be

31
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,910
And now I see

32
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,530
Now I see

33
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,860
Now I see-e-e-e-e

34
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,930
He was long gone when he met me

35
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,550
And I realize the joke is on me

36
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,120
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

37
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,490
So shame on me now

38
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,750
Flew me to places I'd never been

39
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,490
Til you put me down

40
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,050
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in

41
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,990
So shame on me now

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,370
Flew me to places I'd never been

43
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,300
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

44
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,920
Oh, oh

45
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,000
Trouble, trouble, trouble

46
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,240
Oh, oh

47
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,370
Trouble, trouble, trouble

48
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,550
And the saddest fear comes creeping in

49
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:49,090
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah...

50
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,860
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

51
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,950
So shame on me now

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,130
Flew me to places I'd never been

53
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,880
Til you put me down

54
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,380
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in

55
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,640
So shame on me now

56
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,760
Flew me to places I'd never been

57
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,580
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

58
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,380
Oh, oh

59
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,950
Trouble, trouble, trouble

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,630
Oh, oh

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,820
Trouble, trouble, trouble

62
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,950
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,280
Trouble, trouble, trouble

64
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,200
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

65
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,200
Trouble, trouble, trouble

66
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,850
