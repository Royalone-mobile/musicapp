00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,090
Tell me have you ever wanted

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,420
Someone so much it hurts?

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,790
Your lips keep trying to speak

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,250
But you just can't find the words

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,450
Well I had this dream once;

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,830
I held it in my hands

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,100
She was the purest beauty

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,450
But not the common kind

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,820
She had a way about her

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,280
That made you feel alive

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,430
And for a moment

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,880
You made the world stand still

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,470
Yeah we owned the night

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,920
You had me dim the lights;

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,350
You danced just like a child

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,710
The wine spilled on your dress

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,530
And all you did was smile

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,840
Yeah, it was perfect

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,470
I hold it in my mind

24
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:33,630
Yeah, we owned the night

25
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:44,460
    

26
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,420
When the summer rolls around

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,660
And the sun starts sinking down

28
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,930
I still remember you

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,850
Oh, I remember you

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,140
And I wonder where you are

31
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,340
Are you looking at those same stars again?

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,320
Do you remember when?

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,090
We woke under a blanket

34
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,470
All tangled up in skin

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,970
Not knowing in that moment

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,740
We'd never speak again

37
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,010
But it was perfect;

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,190
I never will forget

39
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,540
When we owned the night

40
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:40,800
Yeah, we owned the night
