1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,300
I’m at a payphone trying to call home

2
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,730
All of my change I spent on you

3
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,970
Where have the times gone

4
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,160
Baby, it’s all wrong

5
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,340
Where are the plans we made for two?

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,210
Yeah, I, I know it’s hard to remember

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,390
The people we used to be

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,570
It’s even harder to picture

9
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,700
That you’re not here next to me

10
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,880
You said it’s too late to make it

11
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,130
But is it too late to try?

12
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,890
And in our time that you wasted

13
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,730
All of our bridges burned down

14
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,730
I’ve wasted my nights

15
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,910
You turned out the lights

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,110
Now I’m paralyzed

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,290
Still stuck in that time

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,410
When we called it love

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,450
But even the sun sets in paradise

20
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,680
I’m at a payphone trying to call home

21
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,050
All of my change I spent on you

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,290
Where have the times gone

23
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,480
Baby, it’s all wrong

24
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,760
Where are the plans we made for two?

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,210
If happy ever after did exist

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,640
I would still be holding you like this

27
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,880
And all those fairy tales are full of shit

28
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,440
One more fucking love song, I’ll be sick

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,090
Oh you turned your back on tomorrow

30
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,280
‘Cause you forgot yesterday

31
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,460
I gave you my love to borrow

32
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,710
But you just gave it away

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,890
You can’t expect me to be fine

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,950
I don’t expect you to care

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,640
I know I’ve said it before

36
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,450
But all of our bridges burned down

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,510
I’ve wasted my nights

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,700
You turned out the lights

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,940
Now I’m paralyzed

40
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,130
Still stuck in that time

41
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,250
When we called it love

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,170
But even the sun sets in paradise

43
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,670
I’m at a payphone trying to call home

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,910
All of my change I spent on you

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,160
Where have the times gone

46
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,340
Baby, it’s all wrong

47
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,850
Where are the plans we made for two?

48
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,950
If happy ever after did exist

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,200
I would still be holding you like this

50
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,690
And all those fairy tales are full of shit

51
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,560
One more fucking love song, I’ll be sick

52
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,150
Now I’m at a payphone.....

53
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,410
Man fuck that shit

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,830
I’ll be out spending all this money

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,150
While you’re sitting round wondering

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,580
Why it wasn’t you who came up from nothing

57
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,080
Made it from the botton, now when you see me I’m stunning

58
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,070
And all of my cars start with a push of a button

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,320
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it

60
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,560
Switch the number to my phone so you never could call it

61
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,930
Don’t need my name on my show, you can tell it I’m ballin’

62
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,120
Swish, what a shame could have got picked

63
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,300
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot

64
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,290
So you talk about who you see at the top

65
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,100
Or what you could have saw

66
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,470
But sad to say it’s over for

67
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,840
Phantom pulled up valet open doors

68
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,960
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for

69
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,160
Now it’s me who they want

70
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,750
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you

71
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,390
I’m at a payphone trying to call home

72
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,630
All of my change I spent on you

73
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,930
Where have the times gone

74
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,180
Baby, it’s all wrong

75
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,360
Where are the plans we made for two?

76
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,850
If happy ever after did exist

77
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,970
I would still be holding you like this

78
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,520
And all those fairy tales are full of shit

79
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,270
One more fucking love song, I’ll be sick

80
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,270
Now I’m at a payphone.....
