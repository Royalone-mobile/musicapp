To join me in
the middle of ecstasy

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,090
Feel the melody and the rhythm
of the music around you

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,310
Around you

14

Sounds like

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,880
Feels like our
love’s intertwined

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,440
We can be
two rebels

34
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,770
Breakin the rules

35
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,380
Me and you,

All you gotta

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
Look what I can do
with my feet

38
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,580
Baby,

52
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,160
It’s a
long way now

53
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,290
So high off
the ground

54
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,690
Sending for an angel

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,590
Bring me your heart

56
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,560
Girl, where
did you come from

57
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,750
Got me so undone

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,380
Gaze in your eyes got me saying
“What a beautiful lady!”

59
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,440
No ifs,
and, or maybes

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,370
I’m releasing
my heart

61
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,420
Its feeling amazing

62
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,410
No one else
that matter

63
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,490
You love me

64
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,660
And I won’t let you fall girl,
