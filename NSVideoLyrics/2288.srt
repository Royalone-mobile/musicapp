1
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,230
It's over, it's over, it's over...

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,950
It seems you can't hear me

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:31,810
When I open my mouth you never listen

4
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,930
You say stay, but what does that mean

5
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:46,930
Do you think I honestly want to be reminded forever?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,150
Don't waste your time trying to fix

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,120
What I want to erase

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,980
What I need to forget

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,340
Don't waste your time on me my friend

10
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,860
Friend, what does that even mean

11
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,610
I don't want your hand

12
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,790
You'll only pull me down

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,650
So save your breath

14
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't waste your song on me, on me

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't waste your time

16
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:26,060
It's not easy not answering

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,430
Every time I want to talk to you

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,590
But I can't

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,700
If you only knew the hell I put myself through

20
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,700
Replaying memories in my head of you and I

21
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Every night

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,040
Don't waste your time trying to fix

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,120
What I want to erase

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,870
What I need to forget

25
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,870
Don't waste your time on me my friend

26
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,750
Friend, what does that even mean

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,680
I don't want your hand

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,560
You'll only pull me down

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,760
So save your breath

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,340
Don't waste your song on me, on me

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,340
Don't waste your time

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,130
You're calling

33
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,330
You're talking

34
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,980
You're trying

35
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,350
Trying to get in

36
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,650
But it's over, it's over

37
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,650
It's over, friend

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,930
Don't waste your time trying to fix it

39
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,120
So save your breath

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,910
Don't waste your song on me, on me

41
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,500
Don't waste your time

42
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,020
You held me

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,080
You felt me

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,790
You left me

45
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,050
But it's over, it's over, it's over

46
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,440
You touched me

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,490
You had me

48
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,130
But it's over, it's over

49
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,050
It's over, my friend

50
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:33,050
Don't waste my time
