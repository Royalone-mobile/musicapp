3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,070
Sometimes

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:16,000
You tell me you're in love with me

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,990
That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,960
It's not that I don't want to stay

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,010
But everytime you come too close I move away

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,480
I wanna believe in everything that you say

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,770
cause it sounds so good

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,630
But if you really want me, move slow

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,120
There's things about me you just have to know.

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,850
Sometimes I run

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,770
sometimes I hide

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,130
Sometimes I'm scared of you

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,250
But all I really want is to hold you tight

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,620
Treat you right,

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,470
be with you day and night

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,960
Baby all I need is time.

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,940
I don't wanna be so shy, ah-ah

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,860
Everytime that I'm alone I wonder why

21
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,520
Hope that you will wait for me

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,800
You'll see that, you're the only one for me

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,210
I wanna believe in everything that you say

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,450
Cause it sounds so good

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,430
But if you really want me, move slow

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,850
There's things about me, you just have to know.

27

Baby, all I need is time.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,370
Just hang around and you'll see

35
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,370
There's nowhere I'd rather be

36
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,140
If you love me, trust in me

37
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,570
The way that I trust in you.

38
