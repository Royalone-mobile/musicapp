1
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,670
Miss independent

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,060
Miss self-sufficient

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,040
Miss keep your distance

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,500
Miss unafraid

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,840
Miss out of my way

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,540
Miss don't let a man interfere, no

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,310
Miss on her own

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,290
Miss almost grown

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,190
Miss never let a man help her off her throne

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,250
So, by keeping her heart protected

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,210
She'll never, ever feel rejected

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,660
Little miss apprehensive

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,450
Said ooh, she fell in love

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,550
What is this feeling taking over?

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,190
Thinking no one could open the door

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,690
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,490
What happened to miss independent's

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,220
no longer need to be defensive?

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,350
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,600
Misguided heart

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,320
Miss play it smart

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,340
But she miscalculated

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,720
She didn't wanna end up jaded

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,330
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,100
So, by changing a misconception

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,870
She went in a new direction

28
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,240
And found inside, she felt a connection

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,890
She fell in love

30
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,590
What is this feeling taking over?

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,290
Thinking no one could open the door

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,810
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,490
What happened to miss independent's

34
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,400
no longer need to be defensive?

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,370
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true (when love, is true)

36
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,000
When miss independent walked away

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,560
No time for love that came her way

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,140
She looked in the mirror and thought today

39
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,460
What happened to miss no longer afraid?

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,810
It took some time for her to see

41
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,840
How beautiful love could truly be

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,530
No more talk of why can't that be me

43
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm so glad I've finally seen

44
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,030
What is this feeling taking over?

45
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,770
Thinking no one could open the door

46
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,250
Surprise, it's time, to feel what's real

47
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,030
What happened to miss independent's

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,820
no longer need to be defensive?

49
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:24,050
Goodbye, old you, when love, is true (when love, is true)

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,600
Miss independent
