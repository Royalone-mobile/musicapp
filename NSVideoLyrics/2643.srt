1
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:25,242
Empty spaces fill me up with holes

2
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:32,449
Distant faces with no place left to go

3
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:39,585
Without you within me I can't find no rest

4
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:47,998
Where I’m going is anybody’s guess

5
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:57,203
I tried to go on like I never knew you

6
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:04,481
I’m awake but my world is half asleep

7
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:10,879
I pray for this heart to be unbroken

8
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:22,018
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

9
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:40,327
Voices tell me I should carry on

10
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:47,658
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone

11
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:51,075
Baby, my baby

12
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,766
It’s written on your face

13
00:01:54,801 --> 00:02:05,810
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

14
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:12,629
I'd try to go on like I never knew you

15
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:20,103
I’m awake but my world is half asleep

16
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:26,126
I pray for this heart to be unbroken

17
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:35,767
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

18
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:42,436
I don’t mean to drag it on, but I can’t seem to let you go

19
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:52,059
I don’t wanna make you face this world alone

20
00:02:53,611 --> 00:03:00,099
I wanna let you go (alone)

21
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,980
I'd try to go on like I never knew you

22
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:17,195
I’m awake but my world is half asleep

23
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,581
I pray for this heart to be unbroken

24
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:29,295
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

25
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:35,256
Incomplete
