1
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,830
Elevator buttons

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,700
And morning air

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,670
Stranger's silence

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,970
Makes me wanna take the stairs

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,950
If you were here

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,510
We'd laugh about

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,880
Their vacant stares

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,670
But right now...

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,040
My time is theirs

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,210
Seems like there's always

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,630
Someone who disapproves

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,490
They'll judge it like they

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,860
Know about me and you

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,590
And the verdict comes from laws

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,570
With nothing else to do

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,560
The jury's out...

17
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,040
My choice is you

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,730
So don't you worry

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,590
Your pretty little mind

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,780
People throw rocks

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,200
At things that shine

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,990
And life makes love look hard

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,720
The stakes are high

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,030
The water's rough

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,950
But this love is ours

26
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,710
You never know

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,700
What people have

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,880
Up their sleeves

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,980
Ghosts from your past

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,290
Gonna jump out at me

31
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,530
Lurking in the shadows

32
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,320
With their lipgloss smiles

33
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,370
But I don't care...

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,790
Cause right now you're mine

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,420
And you'll say -

36
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,970
Don't you worry

37
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,470
Your pretty little mind

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,580
People throw rocks

39
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,010
At things that shine

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,490
And life makes love look hard

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,220
The stakes are high

42
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,020
The water's rough

43
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,260
But this love is ours

44
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,880
And it's not theirs to speculate

45
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,430
If it's wrong and..

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,050
Your hands are tough

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,850
But they are where

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,720
Mine belong in...

49
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,150
I'll fight their doubts

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,830
And give you faith

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,870
With this song for you...

52
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,470
Cause I love

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
The gap between your teeth

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,310
And I love

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,060
The riddles that you speak

56
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,220
And any snide remarks

57
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,900
From my father about

58
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,390
Your tattoos

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,070
Will be ignored

60
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,490
Cause my heart is yours

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,360
So don't you worry

62
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,150
Your pretty little mind

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,280
People throw rocks

64
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,890
At things that shine

65
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,430
And life makes love look hard

66
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,240
Don't you worry

67
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,040
Your pretty little mind

68
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,160
People throw rocks

69
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,780
At things that shine

70
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:41,060
But they can't take what's ours

71
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,360
They can't take what's ours

72
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,830
The stakes are high

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,260
The water's rough

74
00:03:52,990 --> 00:04:02,990
But this love is ours
