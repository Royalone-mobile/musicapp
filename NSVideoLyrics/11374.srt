1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:22,300
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us

2
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:37,330
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

3
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,930
Ever thought about losing it

4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,850
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip

5
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,650
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you due for rent

6
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,700
And the grass so green on the other side

7
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,560
Make a n-gga wanna run staight through the fence

8
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,480
Open up the fridge ’bout 20 times

9
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,340
But you still can’t find no food in it

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,530
That’s foolishness

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,960
And sometimes I wonder,

12
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,250
why we care so much about the way we look,

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,180
and the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought,

14
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,230
how much that cost?

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,730
Does it even really matter?

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,580
Cause if life is an uphill battle

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,390
We all tryna climb up the same ol’ ladder

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,370
In the same boat, with the same ol’ battle

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,360
Why so shallow? I’m just asking

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,280
What’s the pattern for the madness

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,200
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,130
Most of us ain’t hollywood actors

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,190
But if it’s all for one, and one for all

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,050
Then maybe one day, we all can ball

25
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,970
Do it one time for the underdogs

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,720
Sincerely yours, from one of yall

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:38,810
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us

28
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:53,830
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,060
I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,290
You just wanna live, been everything so low

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,850
That you could drown in a puddle

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,030
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,830
For all the times no one ever spoke for us

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,690
To every single time that they play this song

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us

36
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,030
When the tides get too high

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,960
And the sea up underneath get so deep

38
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,650
And you feel like you’re just another person

39
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,690
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleed

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,180
Uh, because we won’t be near yet, both of us

41
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,170
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up

42
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,030
And even though we always against the odds

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,020
These are the things that’ve molded us

44
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,450
And if life hadn’t chosen us

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,310
Sometimes I wonder where I woulda wound up

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,480
Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint

47
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,470
Than build it from the ground up, hey

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,640
But if it’s all for one, and one for all

49
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,630
Then maybe one day, we all can ball

50
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,430
Do it one time for the underdogs

51
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,240
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all

52
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:55,140
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us

53
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:11,160
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
