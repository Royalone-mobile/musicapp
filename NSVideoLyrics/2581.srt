1
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,740
I feel like I've been locked up tight

2
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,390
For a century of lonely nights

3
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:30,270
Waiting for someone to release me

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,540
You're lickin' your lips

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,240
And blowing kisses my way

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,620
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,450
Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby...)

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,160
Ooohhh, my body's sayin' let's go

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,430
Ooohhh, but my heart is sayin' no

10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,220
If you wanna be with me

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,790
Baby there's a price to pay

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,500
I'm a genie in a bottle

13
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,860
You gotta rub me the right way

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,430
If you wanna be with me

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,990
I can make your wish come true

16
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,680
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
Gotta like what you do

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,410
(I'm a genie in a bottle baby

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,740
Gotta rub me the right way honey

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,400
I'm a genie in a bottle baby

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,550
Come come, come on and let me out)

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:32,940
    

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,480
The music's fading and the lights down low

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,900
Just one more dance and then
we're good to go

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,110
Waiting for someone

26
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,230
Who needs me

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,300
Hormones racing at the speed of light

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,750
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,700
Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby...)

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,260
Ooohhh, my body's sayin' let's go

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:04,020
Ooohhh, but my heart is sayin' no

32
