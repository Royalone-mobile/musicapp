1
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,050
In the blink of an eye

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,710
I was falling from the sky

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,300
In the blur, you took my breath away

4
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,040
And my heart starts beating

5
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,770
And my lungs start breathing

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,380
And the voice in my head starts screaming

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,860
I’m alive

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,730
You’re like a laserlight

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,400
Burning down, burning down on me

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,250
You’re like a laserlight

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,110
Burning down, burning down on me

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,650
You make me feel good, you make me feel safe

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,510
You make me feel like I can live another day

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,240
You make me feel good, you make me feel safe

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,970
You know I wouldn’t have it any other way

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,970
D-D-D-David G

17
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,400
Je-Je-Je-Jessie J

18
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,550
You and me, face to face

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,390
And there’s so much I could say

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:49,920
And these words, have forever seen the silence

21
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,780
Can you hear that box b-b-breaking

22
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,640
And the world starts sha-sha-shaking

23
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,560
They keep talking, talking, talking

24
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,370
But we’re walking, walking

25
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,350
To the light tonight, tonight

26
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,090
You’re like a laserlight

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,190
Burning down, burning down on me

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,860
You’re like a laserlight

29
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,290
Burning down, burning down on me

30
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,140
You make me feel good, you make me feel safe

31
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,870
You make me feel like I can live another day

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,660
You make me feel good, you make me feel safe

33
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,530
You know I wouldn’t have it any other way

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,520
Have it any other way

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
There’s no stop, stop, stop

36
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,110
Oh oh Oh

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,920
I won’ stop stop, stop

38
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,790
Oh oh Oh

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,710
We won’t stop, stop, stop

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,520
We won’t stop, stop, stop

41
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,630
We won’t stop, stop, stop

42
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,880
In the blink of an eye

43
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,730
I was falling from the sky

44
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,200
In the blur, you took my breath away
