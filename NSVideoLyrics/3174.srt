1
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,270
Hey over there

2
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,840
Please forgive me

3
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,960
If i'm coming on too strong

4
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,210
Hate to stare

5
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,020
But you're winning

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,640
And they're playing my favorite song

7
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,140
So come in little closer

8
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,710
Wanna whisper in your ear

9
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,400
Make it clear, little question

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,620
Wanna note just how you feel

11
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,180
If I feel my heart was beating loud

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,620
If we could escape the crowd some how

13
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,870
If I said I want your body now

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,620
Would you hold it against me

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,190
Cause you feel like paradise

16
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,430
And I need a vacation tonight

17
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,750
So if I said I want your body now

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,060
Would you hold it against me

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,370
Hey you might think

20
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,120
That i'm crazy

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,250
But you know I'm just your type

22
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,870
I might be little hazy

23
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,750
But you just cannot deny

24
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,430
There's a spark in between us

25
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,750
When we're dancin' on the floor

26
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,810
I want more, wanna see it,

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,810
So I'm askin' you tonight

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,500
If I feel my heart was beating loud

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,440
If we could escape the crowd some how

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,310
If I said I want your body now

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,000
Would you hold it against me

32

36
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,310

43
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:50,500
