1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,060
All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now...

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,810
I can't believe i believed

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,900
Everything we had would last

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,250
So young and naive for me to think

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,290
She was from your past

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,620
Silly of me to dream of

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,120
One day having your kids

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,480
Love is so blind

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,670
It feels right when it's wrong

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,930
I can't believe i fell for four years

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,500
And i'm smarter than that

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,130
So young and naive to believe that with me

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,480
You're a changed man

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,880
Foolish of me to compete

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,060
When you cheat with loose women

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,090
It took me some time but now i moved on

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,060
Cuz i realized i got

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,370
Me myself and i

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,640
That's all i got in the end

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,110
That's what i found out

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,280
And it ain't no need to cry

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,930
I took a vow that from now on

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,220
I'm gonna be my own best friend

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,210
Me myself and i

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,150
That's all i got in the end

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,650
That's what i found out

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,760
And it ain't no need to cry

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,710
I took a vow that from now on

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,580
I'm gonna be my own best friend

30
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,310
So controlling , you said that you love me

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,350
But you don't

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,000
Your family told me one day

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,050
I would see it on my own

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,370
Next thing i know i'm dealing

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,830
With your three kids and my home

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,340
I've been so blind

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,750
It feels right when it's wrong

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,370
Now that it's over

39
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,070
Stop calling me

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,620
Come pick up your clothes

41
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,840
No need to front like you're still with me

42
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,010
All your homies know

43
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,760
Even your very best friend

44
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,880
Tried to warn me on the low

45
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,500
It took me some time

46
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,310
But now i am strong

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,930
Because i realized i got

48
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,400
Me myself and i

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,410
That's all i got in the end

50
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,850
That's what i found out

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,080
And it ain't no need to cry

52
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,390
I took a vow that from now on

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,900
I'm gonna be my own best friend

54
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,350
Me myself and i

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,940
That's all i got in the end

56
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,280
That's what i found out

57
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,510
And it ain't no need to cry

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,480
I took a vow that from now on

59
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,180
I'm gonna be my own best friend

60
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,990
Me myself and i

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,550
I know that i will never disappoint myself

62
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,760
All the ladies if you feel me

63
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,860
Help me sing it now

64
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,070
Ya, you hurt me

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,480
But i learned a lot along the way

66
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,360
After all the rain

67
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,590
You'll see the sun come out again

68
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,260
Now I've got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,890
I must have cried a thousand times

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,240
(If ya cried a thousand times ladies you will survive)

71
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,910
I can't regret time spent with you

72
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,970
(Yeah, ya hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)

73
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,520
So I have vowed to make it through (I can see the sunshine, I got Me, Myself and I)
