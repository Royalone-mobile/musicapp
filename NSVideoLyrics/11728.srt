Get in line and settle down

3
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,150
What's your twenty? (Do you copy?)

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,470
Where's your brain? (Do you copy?)

5
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,470
Checking in to check you out

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,740
Concerned about your whereabouts

7
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,230
Copy that (Do you copy?)

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,350
you're acting strange (Do you copy?)

9
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,570
So tell me what is going on

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,830
So heavy I bet

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,730
I'm fine

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,170
(and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)

13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,370
I'm feeling positive for real, i'm all good no

14
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,050
I'm fine

15
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,130
(and nothing's gonna knock this girl down)

16
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,810
It's gotten complicated that's for sure

17
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,350
But you can see it my eyes,

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,030
you can read it on my lips

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,150
I'm trying to get a hold on this

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,830
I really mean it this time

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,010
And you know it's such a trip

22
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,880
Don't get me started

23
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,360

26
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,750
No big deal (I can handle it)

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,990
It'll bounce off me (I can handle it)

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,500
Being around, moved block before,

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,630
doesn't matter anymore

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,890
Here we go again, (are you kiddin' me?)

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,170
Are you insane?(are you kiddin' me?)

32
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,370
We're underneath the avalanche so heavy again

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,610
I'm fine

34
