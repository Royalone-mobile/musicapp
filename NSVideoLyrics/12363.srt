1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,320
I remember when we broke up the first time

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,120
Seeing this is, and had enough, it's like

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,200
We haven't seen each other in a month

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,670
When you, said you, needed space, what?

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,810
When you come around again and say

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,640
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,360
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,870
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,200
Oooh we called it off again last night

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,940
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:54,070
We are never ever ever ever getting back together

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,610
You go talk to your friends talk

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,030
And my friends talk to me

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,810
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,990
Like ever...

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,860
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,630
And me, falling for a screaming that I'm right

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,980
And you, will hide away and find your piece
of mine with some indie record that's much cooler than mine

19
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,390
Oooh you called me up again tonight

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,000
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:44,230
We are never ever ever ever getting back together

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,710
You go talk to your friends talk

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,300
And my friends talk to me

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:56,420
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

25
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,280
I used to think, that we, were forever ever ever

26
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,840
And I used to say never say never

27
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,290
Huh, he calls me up and he's like, I still love you

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,450
And i'm like, I mean, I mean this is exhausting, you know

29
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,270
We are never getting back together, like ever

30
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:39,840
We are never ever ever ever getting back together

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,270
You go talk to your friends talk

32
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,020
And my friends talk to me

33
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,900
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

34
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,660
You go talk to your friends talk

35
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,350
And my friends talk to me

36
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:14,410
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
