As long as you love me
3
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,680
I'm under pressure,
4
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,050
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
5
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,360
Keep it together,
6
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,790
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,280
But hey now, you know girl,
8
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,530
We both know it's a cruel world
9
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,580
But I will take my chances
10
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,890
As long as you love me
11
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,630
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,760
As long as you love me
13
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,720
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,190
I'll be your whole world
24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,430
You can be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,340
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,390
Just take my hand
27
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,130
As you love me we could be starving
 we could be homeless, we could be broke

[Big Sean]
39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,120
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
40
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,250
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it,

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,300
I'll beat ya there

Us, trust...
44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
A couple of things I can't spell without you
45
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,670
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,990
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,240
Man now we stepping out like wow (Oh God)

Camera's pointed shoot,
49
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,050
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
50
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,670
You, you the one that I argue with
 I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with,
51
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,850
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
52
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,270
It's green where you water it
53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,210
So I know we got issues baby true true true
54
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,830
But I'd rather work on this with you
55
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,640
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
56
