1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,125
Baby, I know you are hurting

2
00:00:06,412 --> 00:00:09,125
Right now you feel like you could never love again

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:13,489
Now all I ask is for a chance

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,848
To prove that I love you

5
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:25,835
From the first day that I saw your smiling face

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:35,144
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever

7
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:41,255
Ooh, when I asked you out, you said, "No"

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,204
But I found out darling that you'd been hurt

9
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,822
You felt that you'd never love again

10
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:57,430
I deserve a try honey just once

11
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:01,897
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong

12
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:06,063
You walked in, you were so quick to judge

13
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:10,171
But honey, he's nothing like me

14
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:14,345
I'll never break your heart

15
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,753
I'll never make you cry

16
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:23,652
I'd rather die than live without you

17
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,514
I'll give you all of me

18
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,372
Honey, that's no lie

19
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:31,708
I'll never break your heart

20
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:36,485
I'll never make you cry

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,594
I'd rather die than live without you

22
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,991
I'll give you all of me

23
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:46,021
Honey, that's no lie

24
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:54,785
As time goes by you will get to know me

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:04,228
A little more better, girl, that's the way love goes, baby baby

26
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:12,485
And I know you're afraid to let your feelings show

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,636
And I understand but girl, it's time to let go

28
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:26,461
I deserve a try, honey, just once

29
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:30,819
Give me chance and I'll prove this all wrong

30
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:34,183
You walked in, you were so quick to judge

31
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:38,425
But honey, he's nothing like me

32
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,376
Darling, why can't you see?

33
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:45,297
I'll never break your heart

34
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,787
I'll never make you cry

35
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:54,943
I'd rather die than live without you

36
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,954
I'll give you all of me

37
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,178
Honey, that's no lie

38
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:03,065
I'll never break your heart

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,522
I'll never make you cry

40
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:12,504
I'd rather die than live without you

41
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,644
I'll give you all of me

42
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,587
Honey, that's no lie

43
00:03:16,622 --> 00:03:21,800
No way, no how

44
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:25,572
I swear

45
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:30,162
No way, no how

46
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:34,446
I

47
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,510
I'll never break your heart

48
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:43,297
I'll never make you cry

49
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:48,045
I'd rather die than live without you

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,199
I'll give you all of me

51
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,695
Honey, that's no lie
